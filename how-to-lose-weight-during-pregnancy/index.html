Your belly grows along with it, as does your voice and your hair. But these changes don’t mean that you can’t still gain weight. In fact, you might actually start to lose it during the pregnancy. During this time of growth and development, your fat begins to melt away.</p><p>This means that instead of packing on weight as you do during her second trimester, your belly will curve in a more natural way. And it will also mean that from here on out, you won’t be gaining any more skin or muscle-tone-changing pounds throughout the entire third trimester! </p><h2><strong>What is the difference between gaining weight and losing it during pregnancy?</strong></h2><p>As we mentioned above, your fat Developes during your third and fourth months of pregnancy. And this is also the time when your body is most likely going to start to produce the hormones that are necessary for fat loss. But during this time, your body is also going to be absorbing some of the nutrients with which it is already in contact. And one of these nutrients is vitamin B2, B3 and B5 (antioxidants). A few pages back, we mentioned that pregnant women can increase their intake of fruits and vegetables during this period to help improve the level of these vitamins in the body. Fruits and vegetables not only provide a good source of antioxidants, they also contain antioxidants that are needed for your unborn baby to develop properly. Furthermore, consuming a healthy amount of fibre (fiber is required for proper digestion) will help your baby’s body to absorb the minerals that are needed for him/her to grow.</p><h2><strong>Belly fat during pregnancy: What’s good about it?</strong></h2><p>Belly fat is a normal and healthy part of pregnancy. You will probably see it around your lower region after the second or third month of pregnancy. This is because your baby’s stomach is growing and twisting around as he/she is fed by the mom’s body. It is however important to not allow this fatty tissue to build up too much. This can lead to heart disease, metabolic derangement and even low-birth-weight baby. The best way to control this fat is to consume a healthy amount of carbohydrates throughout the day. This will help to break down your existing fatty tissue into more manageable pieces.</p><h2><strong>Belly fat during pregnancy: Bad for weight loss</strong></h2><p>Well, everyone has a favorite diet, and there is no contest in this regard. The only real way to lose weight during pregnancy is to follow a healthy eating plan. A healthy diet should consist of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and vegetables, light fats, and drinks that will keep your blood pressure moderate (spirits, coffee, etc.). Carbohydrates should comprise of sweets, pastries, and meringue. Fruits should be eaten in moderate amounts throughout the day. And the last thing you should be doing during this non-working period is lifting heavy weights. Doing so will only cause your stomach to expand and cause more fat to build up.</p><h2><strong>How to lose weight during pregnancy: Start with a healthy diet and keep on top of your exercise routine</strong></h2><p>A daily healthy diet can help you to control your hunger pangs. Since you are generally less likely to consume foods that will give you energy, you will be less likely to consume large amounts of calories in the form of fat. A healthy diet should consist of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and proteins. A healthy snack should consist of minimally-calorie items. If you must consume large amounts of calories, these should be broken down into less- calorie-containing components. Exercising can help you to stay toned and flexible. It is therefore a good idea to keep your exercise routine on a keep-away from too heavy a frame. Some easy exercises that you can do at home that are easy on your body include: Bicycle ergometry (BEE) – This is a aerobic exercise that can help you to stay toned. It is therefore good for all stages of pregnancy. Cardiotomy – This is a prone- position exercise that can help to reduce your risk of Ulcers and cerebral palsy. It is therefore a good idea to maintain your upright position throughout pregnancy. Cross-exchangeability – This is a type of passive land management that will help your body to stay happy and healthy throughout the pregnancy.</p><h2><strong>Bottom line</strong></h2><p>Your diet can help you to control your hunger pangs, a daily healthy diet can help you to control your weight gain, and exercise is a key to weight loss. Keep in mind that food isn’t everything when it comes to losing weight during pregnancy. A healthy diet is a crucial part of nutrition during pregnancy. Your doctor will discuss the right foods to put in your diet and how to balance them with your exercise routine during pregnancy.</p></div><footer><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgetshredgo.net%2Fhow-to-lose-weight-during-pregnancy%2F" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://getshredgo.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetshredgo.net%2Fhow-to-lose-weight-during-pregnancy%2F&amp;via=%40getshredgo&amp;text=How%20to%20lose%20weight%20during%20pregnancy" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://getshredgo.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetshredgo.net%2Fhow-to-lose-weight-during-pregnancy%2F" class="js-share linkedin" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://getshredgo.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=How%20to%20lose%20weight%20during%20pregnancy https%3A%2F%2Fgetshredgo.net%2Fhow-to-lose-weight-during-pregnancy%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://getshredgo.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><img src="https://getshredgo.net/media/website/0R1A0176.jpg" height="500" width="438" class="author__avatar" alt="Rish"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://getshredgo.net/authors/rish/" class="invert" title="Rish">Rish</a></h3><p class="author__desc">Rish is a certified fitness &amp; nutrition trainer.

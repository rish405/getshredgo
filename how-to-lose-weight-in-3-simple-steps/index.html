Eat protein, fat, and vegetables</h2><p>Aim to include a variety of foods at each meal. To balance your plate and help you lose weight your meals should include:</p><ul><li>a protein source</li><li>fat source</li><li>vegetables</li><li>a small portion of complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains</li></ul><h2><figure class="is-loaded"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598515214211-89d3c73ae83b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2070&amp;q=80" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="2070" height="1380" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h2><p> </p><h2>Protein</h2><p>Eating a recommended amount of protein is essential to help preserve your health and muscle mass while losing weight</p><p>Evidence suggests that eating adequate protein may improve cardiometabolic risk factors, appetite, and body weight</p><p>Generally, an average male needs about 56–91 grams per day, and the average female needs 46–75 grams per day, but many factors influence protein needs. Here are guidelines to help you figure out how much protein to eat without eating too much</p><ul><li>0.8g/kg of body weight</li><li>1–1.2g/kg of body weight for people 65 and older</li><li>1.4–2g/kg of body weight for athletes</li></ul><p>Diets with adequate protein may also help you reduce cravings and snacking by helping you feel full and satisfied.</p><h2><figure class="is-loaded"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1587996597484-04743eeb56b4?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1287&amp;q=80" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="1287" height="1931" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h2><h2>Healthy protein sources include:</h2><ul><li><strong class="kh jj">meat:</strong> beef, chicken, pork, and lamb</li><li><strong class="kh jj">fish and seafood:</strong> salmon, trout, sardines, and shrimp</li><li><strong class="kh jj">eggs</strong></li><li><strong class="kh jj">plant-based proteins:</strong> beans, legumes, quinoa, tempeh, and tofu</li></ul><h2>Vegetables</h2><p>Don’t be afraid to load your plate with leafy green vegetables. They’re packed with nutrients, and you can eat very large amounts without greatly increasing calories and carbs.</p><p>All vegetables are nutrient-rich and healthy foods to add to your diet, but some vegetables, like potatoes, sweet potatoes, winter squash, and corn, are higher in carbs.</p><p>These vegetables are considered complex carbs because they contain fiber, but you may want to be mindful of serving size when adding these vegetables to your plate.</p><h2><figure class="is-loaded"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1604908817381-f14a28de5347?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1780&amp;q=80" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="1780" height="1780" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h2><h2>Vegetables to include more of:</h2><ul><li>broccoli</li><li>cauliflower</li><li>spinach</li><li>tomatoes</li><li>kale</li><li>Brussels sprouts</li><li>cabbage</li><li>Swiss chard</li><li>lettuce</li><li>cucumber</li><li>peppers</li></ul><h2>Healthy fats</h2><p>Don’t be afraid of eating fats.</p><p>Your body still requires healthy fats no matter what eating plan you choose. Olive oil and avocado oil are great choices for including in your eating plan. Nuts, seeds, olives, and avocados are delicious and healthy additions, as well.</p><p>Other fats such as butter and coconut oil should be used only in moderation due to their higher saturated fat content</p><h2><figure class="is-loaded"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1608138404239-d2f557515ecb?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2070&amp;q=80" data-is-external-image="true" alt="" width="2070" height="1380" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h2><h2>3. Move your body</h2><p>Exercise, while not required to lose weight, can help you lose weight more quickly. Lifting weights has particularly good benefits.</p><p>By lifting weights, you’ll burn calories and help prevent your metabolism from slowing down, which is a common side effect of losing weight.</p><p>Try strength training three to four times a week. If you’re new to lifting weights, a trainer may be able to help you get started. Make sure your doctor is also aware of any new exercise plans.</p><p>If lifting weights is not an option for you, doing some cardio workouts such as walking, jogging, running, cycling, or swimming is very beneficial for weight loss and general health.</p><p data-selectable-paragraph=""> </p></div><footer><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 28, 2022</p><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://rish405.github.io/getshredgo/authors/rish/" class="invert" title="Rish">Rish</a></h3><p class="author__desc">Rish is a certified fitness &amp; nutrition trainer.</p></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://rish405.github.io/getshredgo/intermittent-fasting-101-the-ultimate-beginners-guide/" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">Intermittent Fasting 101 — The Ultimate Beginner’s Guide</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://rish405.github.io/getshredgo/ideal-height-weight-chart-for-men-and-women-indian/" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">Ideal Height Weight Chart for Men &amp; Women</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article></div><div class="post__related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5">Related posts</h2><div class="l-grid l-grid--4"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><header class="c-card__header"><h3 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://rish405.github.io/getshredgo/thyroid-diet-plan-for-weight-loss-indian-female/" class="invert">Thyroid Diet Plan For Weight Loss</a></h3></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><time datetime="2022-09-29T00:37">September 29, 2022</time></footer></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><header class="c-card__header"><h3 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://rish405.github.io/getshredgo/ideal-height-weight-chart-for-men-and-women-indian/" class="invert">Ideal Height Weight Chart for Men &amp; Women</a></h3></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><time datetime="2022-09-28T23:47">September 28, 2022</time></footer></div></article></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

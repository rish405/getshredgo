            "content_html": "<p>Despite the majority of the world concerned about weight loss techniques and gimmicks, we can't neglect the other side that is searching for the opposite. Despite the fact that obesity has been a problem for many people, there are also a lot of people who are suffering from underweight problems. The notion of exercise has always been associated with weight loss, but that is critical in the weight gain process as well. While gaining weight isn't all rainbow and sunshine, it requires a great deal of effort, and eating chocolate treats to boost healthy weight gain isn't exactly the solution to good eating. A healthy diet plan is the only real method to stay healthy and fit that may be achieved with only a good diet plan.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/wMdT1JwG/christopher-campbell-k-FCdf-Lbu6z-A-unsplash.jpg\"></p>\n<p>We have created a diet chart for women to help them add weight in only seven days and a diet plan for weight gain. By eating the foods and meals listed, you'll be satisfied and won't experience any discomfort. All the local ingredients and spices will complement your Indian taste buds.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  align-center\"><strong>Why weight gain is as important as weight loss</strong></p>\n<p>Obesity has become well-known and more common in the last few years, but being underweight has health risks and disadvantages as well. That makes it critical to be aware of weight gain, the proper, and healthy way. Poor nutrition and being underweight are associated with growth and development problems in younger children and teenagers, but adult subjects need to be on the lookout as well. Overeating skinnyness can lead to health difficulties like anaemia, diminished immune functionality, nutrient deficiencies, osteoporosis, and even raise the risk of future surgical complications.  Besides that, numerous mental issues can seep in as well, including eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, which is often connected with being underweight. To ensure you don’t consume junk foods or meals that have higher calorie counts, but follow a healthy diet plan for weight gain so that you may have a healthier and happier future.</p>\n<p>If done properly, and with the <a href=\"https://getshredgo.net/best-online-personal-trainer-for-weight-loss-india/\">guidance of a fitness coach</a>, weight gain of the body results in both muscle and fat weight increase. It is preferable to stay away from tasty, greasy food and look at whole grain and meals containing healthy fats instead.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  align-center\"><strong>8 tips to gain weight in a healthy way:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid drinking water before your meal. This habit can fill your stomach even before eating enough hence leading you to eat less nutritious food and be filled in liquid instead.</li>\n<li>Add more eating hours. If you aren’t the type who can take heavy meals at once then keep snack breaks where you can munch on healthy and tasty foods.</li>\n<li>Switch over to milk from carbonated drinks. Drinking whole milk is a great and simple way to incorporate high-quality protein and calories when you wish to quench your thirst. Choosing carbonated sugary drinks will only increase sugar levels in your body instead of doing it any good.</li>\n<li>Though opting for all-natural things is always better trying weight gain shakes which are made from organic products is not a bad idea for that little extra calorie intake of the day.</li>\n<li>Use larger plates. Eating in bigger plates makes sure you are taking meals in bigger proportions and the human psyche of finishing what is on your plate will guarantee you get the nutrients of that one full plate at least.</li>\n<li>Getting good sleep is important as it helps in muscle growth which will further add muscle mass to your body as well.</li>\n<li>Reducing stress should be our top priority as well, as stress can affect hormones and thus lead to change in appetite and metabolization.</li>\n<li>Keep your proteins for first and vegetables for the last. When your plate is a mix of everything it's always better to eat calorie-dense foods like protein first and vegetables at the last of the meal so if you wish to leave anything out the lower calorie foods can be skipped.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/tJtRWTfC/gursimrat-ganda-TT042b-Oytl-U-unsplash.jpg\"></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  align-center\"><strong>List of healthy food items you can incorporate in your diet plan</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Whole grains:</strong> Whole grain foods like bread, and cereals are packed with healthy complex carbohydrates, fibre, and various other nutrients.</li>\n<li><strong>High-calorie foods:</strong> Taking starchy food like potato, corn, legumes, and more that are high in calories is a great way to boost the growth of muscles as well as helps in speeding up weight gain.</li>\n<li><strong>Protein-rich foods/ meat:</strong> If non-vegetarian food works for you then it's advised to add leaner cuts in your diet which are healthier and will provide enough protein. So if you are a fan of seafood as well then going for a fish like salmon would be better than any other heavy fish like canned tuna. Or else for vegetarians, indulging in paneer, soya, chickpeas is a great option to get the required protein.</li>\n<li><strong>Nuts and nut butters:</strong> Calorie-dense nuts are always a great option as they can be added to various dishes and are a healthy snack to munch on as well.</li>\n<li><strong>Milk:</strong> For those who are looking for some muscle gain, milk can be an ideal choice. A balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats, is a complete meal in itself.</li>\n<li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Be it dry fruits or raw natural fruits, incorporating them into your diet plan is always advised as they are rich in calories as well as nutrients.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To smooth and simple weight gain journey, you should i<strong>ncrease 300-400 calories to your daily calorie intake</strong>, but 700 calories can be consumed for quicker results. You should gradually increase your daily calorie intake rather than consuming all fats at once. You should <strong>also include weight training</strong> to your daily routine along with a diet plan to accelerate your weight gain journey and obtain better, healthier outcomes.</p>\n<p>Our 7-day diet chart for weight gain for females, which consists of 1400-1500 calories, is ideal for the majority and common as well.

            "content_html": "<h2><strong>Strength and conditioning drills</strong></h2>\n<p>Strength and conditioning drills are a specialized form of workouts that use bodyweight exercises to improve overall strength, both physically and mentally. These types of workouts are not typical high-intensity cardio sessions that might leave you feeling sore for days. They are more about challenging your body in new ways and helping you overcome your mental barriers. This is beneficial because when you’re lifting weights and doing strength-focused exercises, you’re not putting too much pressure on your joints.</p>\n<p>You’re also challenging your muscles in new ways and building stronger muscles — which is what you need to prevent injury and perform at your best. Having a personal trainer will allow you to do strength and conditioning drills to improve your overall strength and flexibility. You may have seen some of these exercises on social media — like the handstand, human flag, and one-legged squats.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">These are incredible workouts to build strength in your upper and lower body. Strength and conditioning drills are not only beneficial for athletic performance but also for mental health. These exercises can help manage stress, anxiety, and depression.</p>\n<h2><strong>Nutrition plan</strong></h2>\n<p>A good nutrition plan is key to achieving better results in fitness, as well as in other areas of your life. A nutrition plan created by a nutrition coach is specifically designed for your goals, timelines, and lifestyle. It takes into account any allergies, intolerances, or dietary restrictions you might have.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">A nutrition coach will take all of that information into account and create a custom-tailored meal plan that fits your specific needs and your desired outcome. A good nutrition plan will include healthy, whole foods and balanced meal portions to fuel your body with the right nutrients it needs, as well as healthy snacks to keep you satiated throughout the day.</p>\n<p>A nutrition coach will also be able to identify any eating habits that might be sabotaging your results or that might not be the best for your overall health. They will then create a plan to help you overcome those eating habits and work towards a healthier lifestyle.</p>\n<h2><strong>Accountability</strong></h2>\n<p>Working out with a personal trainer will hold you accountable to your fitness journey. When you have a trainer, you’re not just paying them for them to give you a workout plan and leave; you’re paying them to stay with you throughout your whole journey and help you get to where you want to be. They are there to support you in both your good and bad times.</p>\n<p>They are there to encourage you when you feel like you want to give up and push you to keep going when you feel like you can’t go any further. A personal trainer will also know what to say at the right time to keep you accountable and help you stay on track. They will know what to say to boost your energy when you’re feeling tired and what to say to help keep you motivated when you feel like you want to give up.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">Working out with a personal trainer can help you stay accountable when you might normally give up and leave the gym after one or two workouts.</p>\n<h2><strong>Confidence builder</strong></h2>\n<p>Depending on the type of personal trainer you choose, working out with them can help build your confidence in many different ways. Confidence is not something that is built overnight, but it is something that can be built through consistent, daily actions. A personal trainer will challenge you both physically and mentally to push you outside of your comfort zone and help you become a better version of yourself.</p>\n<p>They will push you in your workouts and help you improve your strength, endurance, and overall fitness level. A personal trainer will understand what you’re hoping to achieve with your workouts and help you get there even faster, giving you more confidence along the way.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">Working out with a personal trainer can help build your confidence in many different ways: It can help you build your self-esteem, strengthen your mental health, and boost your energy level.</p>\n<h2><strong>Better tracking of progress</strong></h2>\n<p>A personal trainer will not only push you in your workouts, but they will also track your progress and make sure you’re progressing at the right pace. They will also be able to help you identify areas you need to improve on and help you stay accountable for those goals. They will help you stay on track with your workouts, as well as your diet plan.</p>\n<p>You might have seen those posts on social media from friends who are trying to lose weight or gain muscle, with the caption: “Day 1!” It’s nice that they are trying to stay accountable for their goals, but sometimes it can be tough to follow along with someone who isn’t a professional. Working out with a personal trainer will allow you to track your progress and get feedback from an expert.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">They will be able to help you track your progress with your workouts, as well as help you identify areas you need to improve on and stay on track with those goals.</p>\n<h2><strong>Better performance</strong></h2>\n<p>Working out with a personal trainer will allow them to assess your fitness level and help you improve your performance and reach new fitness goals. Depending on your fitness level, a personal trainer will help you track your progress and challenge you to meet your fitness goals. They will make sure you are performing the exercises at the right intensity level.</p>\n<p>They will also help you develop a better fitness routine based on your goals and specific fitness level. You might have specific performance goals you want to achieve, like completing a certain distance in a marathon or completing a certain time in a certain race.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">A personal trainer can help you reach those goals by tracking your progress, giving you the right advice, and challenging you to push yourself further than you thought you could.</p>\n<h2><strong>Better body composition</strong></h2>\n<p>Working out with a personal trainer is beneficial because they will be able to help you track your progress towards better body composition. Body composition refers to the ratio between your fat and muscle mass. You might have the same weight, but the composition of that weight might be different because of the types of muscles being developed.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">A personal trainer will be able to help you track your progress towards better body composition by first, assessing your current fitness level, and then creating an effective workout routine for you to improve your overall fitness.</p>\n<p>A personal trainer will also make sure you are eating a healthy balanced diet to help build muscle and decrease fat.</p>\n<h2><strong>Better injury prevention</strong></h2>\n<p>Working out with a personal trainer will help you prevent injuries and meet your fitness goals. A good personal trainer will be able to identify your weak areas and help you strengthen those areas to prevent injury and meet your goals faster.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">A personal trainer will create an effective workout routine for you to strengthen your weak areas and help you prevent injury.

As you get closer to bed time, your body begins to release certain hormones that help you fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night.</p>\n<p>Exercising too close to bedtime, however, can cause your body to release the wrong type of hormones — which can disrupt your sleep and keep you awake at night. A personal trainer will be able to help you schedule your workouts at the right time and type of workout to help you get better sleep.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Having a personal trainer on your side is like having an additional nutrition coach. They are there to push you in your workouts and help you stay accountable for sticking to your diet plan.

            "content_html": "<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Whether you want to lose weight for a special occasion or simply improve your health, weight loss is a common goal.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">To set realistic expectations, you may want to know what a healthy weight loss rate is.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This article explains the factors that affect how long it may take you to lose weight.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*NepXHJG7AoK2CyHE\" data-image-id=\"0*NepXHJG7AoK2CyHE\" data-width=\"4680\" data-height=\"3120\" data-unsplash-photo-id=\"lrQPTQs7nQQ\" data-is-featured=\"true\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Weight loss occurs when you consistently consume fewer calories than you burn each day.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Conversely, weight gain happens when you consistently eat more calories than you burn.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Any food or beverage you consume that has calories counts toward your overall calorie intake.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">That said, the number of calories you burn each day, which is known as energy or calorie expenditure, is a bit more complicated.</p>\n<ul class=\"postList\">\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Resting metabolic rate (RMR)- </strong>This is the number of calories your body needs to maintain normal bodily functions, such as breathing and pumping blood.</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Thermic effect of food (TEF) -</strong>This refers to the calories used to digest, absorb, and metabolise food.</li>\n<li class=\"graf graf--li\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Thermic effect of activity (TEA) -</strong>These are the calories you use during exercise. TEA can also include non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), which accounts for the calories used for activities like yard work and fidgeting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If the number of calories you consume equals the number of calories you burn, you maintain your body weight.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">If you want to lose weight, you must create a negative calorie balance by consuming fewer calories than you burn or burning more calories through increased activity.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*2IADS9BPZ8vAPtHm\" data-image-id=\"0*2IADS9BPZ8vAPtHm\" data-width=\"5632\" data-height=\"3755\" data-unsplash-photo-id=\"5jctAMjz21A\"></figure></figure>\n<blockquote class=\"graf graf--blockquote\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">Weight loss occurs when you consistently consume fewer calories than you burn each day.</em></blockquote>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Several factors affect the rate at which you lose weight. Many of them are out of your control.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Gender</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Your fat-to-muscle ratio greatly affects your ability to lose weight.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Because women typically have a greater fat-to-muscle ratio than men, they have a 5–10% lower RMR than men of the same height. Yet, while men tended to lose weight quicker than women, the study didn’t analyze gender-based differences in the ability to maintain weight loss.</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Age</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One of the many bodily changes that occur with aging is alterations in body composition — fat mass increases and muscle mass decreases.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">This change, along with other factors like the declining calorie needs of your major organs, contributes to a lower RMR</p>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Starting point</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Your initial body mass and composition may also affect how quickly you can expect to lose weight.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">It’s important to understand that different absolute weight losses (in pounds) can correspond to the same relative (%) weight loss in different individuals. Ultimately, weight loss is a complex process.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Although a heavier person may lose double the amount of weight, a person with less weight may lose an equal percentage of their body weight (10/250 = 4% versus 5/125 = 4%).</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For example, a person weighing 300 pounds (136 kg) may lose 10 pounds (4.5 kg) after reducing their daily intake by 1,000 calories and increasing physical activity for 2 weeks.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Z-7_8zmgL7UTcQYb\" data-image-id=\"0*Z-7_8zmgL7UTcQYb\" data-width=\"7337\" data-height=\"5503\" data-unsplash-photo-id=\"2q-c_xUtjh0\"></figure></figure>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Calorie deficit</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">You must create a negative calorie balance to lose weight. The extent of this calorie deficit affects how quickly you lose weight.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">For example, consuming 500 fewer calories per day for 8 weeks will likely result in greater weight loss than eating 200 fewer calories per day.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">However, be sure not to make your calorie deficit too large.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Doing so would not only be unsustainable but also put you at risk for nutrient deficiencies. What’s more, it might make you more likely to lose weight in the form of muscle mass rather than fat mass.</p>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Xg_yTeW7xC7vZIGP\" data-image-id=\"0*Xg_yTeW7xC7vZIGP\" data-width=\"6000\" data-height=\"4000\" data-unsplash-photo-id=\"rUc9hVE-L-E\"></figure></figure>\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3\">Sleep</h3>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Sleep tends to be an overlooked yet crucial component of weight loss.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Chronic sleep loss can significantly hinder weight loss and the speed at which you shed pounds.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Just one night of sleep deprivation has been shown to increase your desire for high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods, such as cookies, cakes, sugary beverages, and chips.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">One 2-week study randomized participants on a calorie-restricted diet to sleep either 5.5 or 8.5 hours each night.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Those who slept 5.5 hours lost 55% less body fat and 60% more lean body mass than those who slept 8.5 hours per night</p>\n<blockquote class=\"graf graf--blockquote\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">Age, gender, and sleep are just a few of the many factors that affect weight loss. Others include some medical conditions, your genetics, and the use of certain medications.</em></blockquote>\n<figure class=\"graf graf--figure\"><figure class=\"graf-image\"><img  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*FbK-0fT-jB8YyUrm\" data-image-id=\"0*FbK-0fT-jB8YyUrm\" data-width=\"6000\" data-height=\"4000\" data-unsplash-photo-id=\"5ddH9Y2accI\"></figure></figure>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Though weight loss may occur faster at the start of a program, experts recommend a weight loss of 1–3 pounds (0.45–1.36 kg) per week, or about 1% of your body weight.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Also, keep in mind that weight loss is not a linear process. Some weeks you may lose more, while other weeks you may lose less or none at all.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">So don’t be discouraged if your weight loss slows or plateaus for a few days.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Using a food diary, as well as weighing yourself regularly, may help you stay on track.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Research shows that people who employ self-monitoring techniques, such as recording your dietary intake and weight, are more successful at losing weight and keeping it off than those who don’t.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"graf graf--blockquote\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--blockquote-em\">Losing weight too quickly can lead to problems like gallstones, muscle loss, and extreme fatigue. Experts recommend a moderate weight loss of 1–3 pounds (0.45–1.36 kg) per week, or about 1% of your body weight.</em></blockquote>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Weight loss occurs when you eat fewer calories than you burn.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Many factors affect your <a href=\"https://getshredgo.net\" data-href=\"https://getshredgo.net\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">weight loss rate</a>, including your gender, age, starting weight, sleep, and the extent of your calorie deficit.</p>\n<p class=\"graf graf--p\">Aiming to lose 1–3 pounds (0.45–1.36 kg) per week is a safe and sustainable way to reach your goals.</p>",

Brazil or Hazel nuts:</strong> Brazil or Hazel nuts are rich sources of selenium that can help in the converting the inactive thyroid hormones to its active form thus improving the function of the thyroid gland.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Bone Broth:</strong> Hypothyroidism causes the bones to weaken. Bone broth is the clear and protein-rich liquid which is prepared by simmering meaty joints and bones in water. It strengthens your bones as it has amino acids and collagen which manages the weight, thus managing hypothyroidism.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Fish and shellfish:</strong> Fatty fish contain high amounts of Omega-3 fatty acids and selenium that helps in controlling the cholesterol levels and helps in the normal functioning of the thyroid gland. Eat fishes like salmon, tuna, sardine, etc. and grill them.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Olive Oil:</strong> Olive oil is rich in healthy fats and should be used to prepare meals for hypothyroid diet. It lowers the LDL cholesterol keeping your heart healthy. Also, meals prepared in olive oil can keep you full for long thus reducing your appetite too.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Dairy:</strong> Low-fat dairy products such as Greek yoghurt, cheese and low-fat milk are good for your body while trying to manage hypothyroidism. It boosts iodine production in short and long term.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Eggs:</strong> Eggs each day are excellent for breakfast in hypothyroidism people. Eggs are a rich source of protein and also contain fat-soluble vitamins. They boost the iodine levels in the body. You feel full for a longer time and would avoid reaching out for unhealthy or junk foods.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong><span class=\"gvxzyvdx aeinzg81 t7p7dqev gh25dzvf tb6i94ri gupuyl1y i2onq4tn k1z55t6l oog5qr5w tes86rjd pbevjfx6\">Dietary recommendations</span></strong></p>\n<div class=\"mfn553m3\"> </div>\n<div class=\"mfn553m3\"><span class=\"gvxzyvdx aeinzg81 t7p7dqev gh25dzvf tb6i94ri gupuyl1y i2onq4tn k1z55t6l oog5qr5w tes86rjd pbevjfx6\">Include food items that are rich in the following:</span></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div class=\"mfn553m3\"><span class=\"gvxzyvdx aeinzg81 t7p7dqev gh25dzvf tb6i94ri gupuyl1y i2onq4tn k1z55t6l oog5qr5w tes86rjd pbevjfx6\">● <strong>Zinc, Selenium: </strong> These minerals help in the production of thyroid in the body, the good sources are meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, and dairy products.</span></div>\n<div class=\"mfn553m3\"><span class=\"gvxzyvdx aeinzg81 t7p7dqev gh25dzvf tb6i94ri gupuyl1y i2onq4tn k1z55t6l oog5qr5w tes86rjd pbevjfx6\">● <strong>Iodine</strong>: Seafood, iodized salt, dairy products.</span></div>\n<div class=\"mfn553m3\"><span class=\"gvxzyvdx aeinzg81 t7p7dqev gh25dzvf tb6i94ri gupuyl1y i2onq4tn k1z55t6l oog5qr5w tes86rjd pbevjfx6\"><strong>● Omega3<i>:</i></strong> Walnuts, chia seeds, flax seeds, fish, and other seafood.</span></div>\n<div class=\"mfn553m3\"><span class=\"gvxzyvdx aeinzg81 t7p7dqev gh25dzvf tb6i94ri gupuyl1y i2onq4tn k1z55t6l oog5qr5w tes86rjd pbevjfx6\">● <strong>Fibers</strong>: Fresh whole fruits and vegetables, leafy greens, nuts and seeds, and whole grains are good sources of soluble fiber, which can help regulate blood sugar levels.</span></div>\n<p class=\"mfn553m3 msg msg--highlight \"><span class=\"gvxzyvdx aeinzg81 t7p7dqev gh25dzvf tb6i94ri gupuyl1y i2onq4tn k1z55t6l oog5qr5w tes86rjd pbevjfx6\"><strong>Cruciferous</strong> vegetables (canola, cabbage, turnip, watercress, arugula, radish, etc.), as well as foods that contain soybean and are well-cooked, can be consumed.</span></p>\n<div> </div>\n<div class=\"mfn553m3\"><span class=\"gvxzyvdx aeinzg81 t7p7dqev gh25dzvf tb6i94ri gupuyl1y i2onq4tn k1z55t6l oog5qr5w tes86rjd pbevjfx6\">It is recommended to limit the consumption of sweets, sugar, and processed foods.</span></div>\n<div class=\"mfn553m3\"><span class=\"gvxzyvdx aeinzg81 t7p7dqev gh25dzvf tb6i94ri gupuyl1y i2onq4tn k1z55t6l oog5qr5w tes86rjd pbevjfx6\">Alcohol consumption should also be limited.</span></div>\n<div>\n<div class=\"l7ghb35v kjdc1dyq kmwttqpk gh25dzvf jikcssrz n3t5jt4f\">\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><span style=\"color: var(--headings-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: 1.60181em; font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold); letter-spacing: var(--letter-spacing);\">Workout for Hypothyroidism:</span></div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"l7ghb35v kjdc1dyq kmwttqpk gh25dzvf jikcssrz n3t5jt4f\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Working out for 3 hours in a week helps in improving both physical and mental health and raises our quality of life.

Eat protein, fat, and vegetables</h2>\n<p>Aim to include a variety of foods at each meal. To balance your plate and help you lose weight your meals should include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a protein source</li>\n<li>fat source</li>\n<li>vegetables</li>\n<li>a small portion of complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><figure class=\"is-loaded\"><img  src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598515214211-89d3c73ae83b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2070&amp;q=80\" alt=\"\" width=\"2070\" height=\"1380\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Protein</h2>\n<p>Eating a recommended amount of protein is essential to help preserve your health and muscle mass while losing weight</p>\n<p>Evidence suggests that eating adequate protein may improve cardiometabolic risk factors, appetite, and body weight</p>\n<p>Generally, an average male needs about 56–91 grams per day, and the average female needs 46–75 grams per day, but many factors influence protein needs. Here are guidelines to help you figure out how much protein to eat without eating too much</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0.8g/kg of body weight</li>\n<li>1–1.2g/kg of body weight for people 65 and older</li>\n<li>1.4–2g/kg of body weight for athletes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Diets with adequate protein may also help you reduce cravings and snacking by helping you feel full and satisfied.</p>\n<h2><figure class=\"is-loaded\"><img  src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1587996597484-04743eeb56b4?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1287&amp;q=80\" alt=\"\" width=\"1287\" height=\"1931\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></h2>\n<h2>Healthy protein sources include:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"kh jj\">meat:</strong> beef, chicken, pork, and lamb</li>\n<li><strong class=\"kh jj\">fish and seafood:</strong> salmon, trout, sardines, and shrimp</li>\n<li><strong class=\"kh jj\">eggs</strong></li>\n<li><strong class=\"kh jj\">plant-based proteins:</strong> beans, legumes, quinoa, tempeh, and tofu</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Vegetables</h2>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to load your plate with leafy green vegetables. They’re packed with nutrients, and you can eat very large amounts without greatly increasing calories and carbs.</p>\n<p>All vegetables are nutrient-rich and healthy foods to add to your diet, but some vegetables, like potatoes, sweet potatoes, winter squash, and corn, are higher in carbs.</p>\n<p>These vegetables are considered complex carbs because they contain fiber, but you may want to be mindful of serving size when adding these vegetables to your plate.</p>\n<h2><figure class=\"is-loaded\"><img  src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1604908817381-f14a28de5347?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1780&amp;q=80\" alt=\"\" width=\"1780\" height=\"1780\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></h2>\n<h2>Vegetables to include more of:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>broccoli</li>\n<li>cauliflower</li>\n<li>spinach</li>\n<li>tomatoes</li>\n<li>kale</li>\n<li>Brussels sprouts</li>\n<li>cabbage</li>\n<li>Swiss chard</li>\n<li>lettuce</li>\n<li>cucumber</li>\n<li>peppers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Healthy fats</h2>\n<p>Don’t be afraid of eating fats.</p>\n<p>Your body still requires healthy fats no matter what eating plan you choose. Olive oil and avocado oil are great choices for including in your eating plan. Nuts, seeds, olives, and avocados are delicious and healthy additions, as well.</p>\n<p>Other fats such as butter and coconut oil should be used only in moderation due to their higher saturated fat content</p>\n<h2><figure class=\"is-loaded\"><img  src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1608138404239-d2f557515ecb?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2070&amp;q=80\" alt=\"\" width=\"2070\" height=\"1380\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></h2>\n<h2>3. Move your body</h2>\n<p>Exercise, while not required to lose weight, can help you lose weight more quickly. Lifting weights has particularly good benefits.</p>\n<p>By lifting weights, you’ll burn calories and help prevent your metabolism from slowing down, which is a common side effect of losing weight.</p>\n<p>Try strength training three to four times a week. If you’re new to lifting weights, a trainer may be able to help you get started. Make sure your doctor is also aware of any new exercise plans.</p>\n<p>If lifting weights is not an option for you, doing some cardio workouts such as walking, jogging, running, cycling, or swimming is very beneficial for weight loss and general health.</p>\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"> </p>",

Ancient hunter-gatherers didn’t have supermarkets, refrigerators or food available year-round. Sometimes they couldn’t find anything to eat.</p>\n<p>As a result, humans evolved to be able to function without food for extended periods of time.</p>\n<p>In fact, fasting from time to time is more natural than always eating 3–4 (or more) meals per day.</p>\n<p>Fasting is also often done for religious or spiritual reasons, including in Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism.</p>\n<h1><figure class=\"is-loaded\"><img  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*d0nGsMwHS2O5GPBV\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"927\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></h1>\n<h3>Intermittent Fasting Methods</h3>\n<p>There are several different ways of doing intermittent fasting — all of which involve splitting the day or week into eating and fasting periods.</p>\n<p>During the fasting periods, you eat either very little or nothing at all.</p>\n<p>These are the most popular methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"ks jj\">The 16/8 method:</strong> Also called the Leangains protocol, it involves skipping breakfast and restricting your daily eating period to 8 hours, such as 1–9 p.m. Then you fast for 16 hours in between.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"ks jj\">Eat-Stop-Eat:</strong> This involves fasting for 24 hours, once or twice a week, for example by not eating from dinner one day until dinner the next day.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"ks jj\">The 5:2 diet:</strong> With this method, you consume only 500–600 calories on two nonconsecutive days of the week, but eat normally the other 5 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By reducing your calorie intake, all of these methods should cause weight loss as long as you don’t compensate by eating much more during the eating periods.</p>\n<p>Many people find the 16/8 method to be the simplest, most sustainable and easiest to stick to. It’s also the most popular.</p>\n<h1><figure class=\"is-loaded\"><img  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*vZudnmIUJlyxG0XH\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></h1>\n<h3>How It Affects Your Cells and Hormones</h3>\n<p>When you fast, several things happen in your body on the cellular and molecular level.</p>\n<p>For example, your body adjusts hormone levels to make stored body fat more accessible.</p>\n<p>Your cells also initiate important repair processes and change the expression of genes.</p>\n<p>Here are some changes that occur in your body when you fast:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"ks jj\">Human Growth Hormone (HGH):</strong> The levels of growth hormone skyrocket, increasing as much as 5-fold. This has benefits for fat loss and muscle gain, to name a few.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"ks jj\">Insulin:</strong> Insulin sensitivity improves and levels of insulin drop dramatically. Lower insulin levels make stored body fat more accessible.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"ks jj\">Cellular repair:</strong> When fasted, your cells initiate cellular repair processes. This includes autophagy, where cells digest and remove old and dysfunctional proteins that build up inside cells.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"ks jj\">Gene expression:</strong> There are changes in the function of genes related to longevity and protection against disease.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes in hormone levels, cell function and gene expression are responsible for the health benefits of intermittent fasting.</p>\n<h1><figure class=\"is-loaded\"><img  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*nZyKxXzMaUYSN00P\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"787\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></h1>\n<h3>Health Benefits</h3>\n<p>Many studies have been done on intermittent fasting, in both animals and humans.</p>\n<p>These studies have shown that it can have powerful benefits for weight control and the health of your body and brain. It may even help you live longer.</p>\n<p>Here are the main health benefits of intermittent fasting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong class=\"ks jj\">Weight loss:</strong> As mentioned above, intermittent fasting can help you lose weight and belly fat, without having to consciously restrict calories.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"ks jj\">Insulin resistance:</strong> Intermittent fasting can reduce insulin resistance, lowering blood sugar by 3–6% and fasting insulin levels by 20–31%, which should protect against type 2 diabetes (1).</li>\n<li><strong class=\"ks jj\">Inflammation:</strong> Some studies show reductions in markers of inflammation, a key driver of many chronic diseases.</li>\n<li><strong class=\"ks jj\">Heart health:</strong> Intermittent fasting may reduce “bad” LDL cholesterol, blood triglycerides, inflammatory markers, blood sugar and insulin resistance — all risk factors for heart disease.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><figure class=\"is-loaded\"><img  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*oYEnmXbIyfhGK5dj\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"844\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></h1>\n<h3>Makes Your Healthy Lifestyle Simpler</h3>\n<p>Eating healthy is simple, but it can be incredibly hard to maintain.</p>\n<p>One of the main obstacles is all the work required to plan for and cook healthy meals.</p>\n<p>Intermittent fasting can make things easier, as you don’t need to plan, cook or clean up after as many meals as before.</p>\n<p>For this reason, intermittent fasting is very popular among the life-hacking crowd, as it improves your health while simplifying your life at the same time.</p>\n<h1><figure class=\"is-loaded\"><img  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*RiFOyEzD5dfjmqAq\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1120\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></h1>\n<h3>Safety and Side Effects</h3>\n<p>Hunger is the main side effect of intermittent fasting.</p>\n<p>You may also feel weak and your brain may not perform as well as you’re used to.</p>\n<p>This may only be temporary, as it can take some time for your body to adapt to the new meal schedule.</p>\n<p>If you have a medical condition, you should consult with your doctor before trying intermittent fasting.</p>\n<p>This is particularly important if you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have diabetes.</li>\n<li>Have problems with blood sugar regulation.</li>\n<li>Have low blood pressure.</li>\n<li>Take medications.</li>\n<li>Are underweight.</li>\n<li>Have a history of eating disorders.</li>\n<li>Are a woman who is trying to conceive.</li>\n<li>Are a woman with a history of amenorrhea.</li>\n<li>Are pregnant or breastfeeding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All that being said, intermittent fasting has an outstanding safety profile. There is nothing dangerous about not eating for a while if you’re healthy and well-nourished overall.</p>\n<h1><figure class=\"is-loaded\"><img  src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*UqeirOWkzaxKzO9V\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></h1>\n<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>\n<p>Here are answers to the most common questions about intermittent fasting.</p>\n<h4 id=\"b88b\" class=\"lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj\">1. Can I Drink Liquids During the Fast?</h4>\n<p>Yes. Water, coffee, tea and other non-caloric beverages are fine. Do not add sugar to your coffee. Small amounts of milk or cream may be okay.</p>\n<p>Coffee can be particularly beneficial during a fast, as it can blunt hunger.</p>\n<h4 id=\"a98e\" class=\"lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj\">2. Isn’t It Unhealthy to Skip Breakfast?</h4>\n<p>No. The problem is that most stereotypical breakfast skippers have unhealthy lifestyles. If you make sure to eat healthy food for the rest of the day then the practice is perfectly healthy.</p>\n<h4 id=\"7dc6\" class=\"lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj\">3. Can I Take Supplements While Fasting?</h4>\n<p>Yes. However, keep in mind that some supplements like fat-soluble vitamins may work better when taken with meals.</p>\n<h4 id=\"3f0e\" class=\"lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj\">4. Can I Work out While Fasted?</h4>\n<p>Yes, fasted workouts are fine. Some people recommend taking branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) before a fasted workout.</p>\n<h4 id=\"6346\" class=\"lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj\">5. Will Fasting Cause Muscle Loss?</h4>\n<p>All weight loss methods can cause muscle loss, which is why it’s important to lift weights and keep your protein intake high. One study showed that intermittent fasting causes less muscle loss than regular calorie restriction.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2cff\" class=\"lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj\">6. Will Fasting Slow Down My Metabolism?</h4>\n<p>No. Studies show that short-term fasts actually boost metabolism. However, longer fasts of 3 or more days can suppress metabolism.</p>\n<h4 id=\"b7f2\" class=\"lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj\">7. Should Kids Fast?</h4>\n<p>Allowing your child to fast is probably a bad idea.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>High cholesterol is a pretty common issue everywhere. However, because this condition can often present without any real symptoms, you may not even know you have it until you visit your doctor.</p>\n<p>If you’re wondering what causes high cholesterol, what to do if you’ve been diagnosed with it, and if there are ways to reverse it (hint: there are), read on for all the answers.</p>\n<h1>What is Cholesterol?</h1>\n<p>Cholesterol is a type of lipid. It’s a waxy, fat-like substance that your liver produces naturally. It’s vital for the formation of cell membranes, certain hormones, and vitamin D.</p>\n<p>Cholesterol doesn’t dissolve in water, so it can’t travel through your blood on its own. To help transport cholesterol, your liver produces lipoproteins.</p>\n<p>Lipoproteins are particles made from fat and protein. They carry cholesterol and triglycerides, another type of lipid, through your bloodstream. The two major forms of lipoprotein are low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL).</p>\n<p>LDL cholesterol is any cholesterol carried by low-density lipoproteins. If your blood contains too much LDL cholesterol, you may be diagnosed with high cholesterol. Without treatment, high cholesterol may lead to many health issues, including heart attack and stroke.</p>\n<p>High cholesterol rarely causes symptoms in the beginning. That’s why it’s important to get your cholesterol levels checked on a regular basis.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*9AVWpq5GuM9M-wbN\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1225\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<h1>High cholesterol symptoms</h1>\n<p>In most cases, high cholesterol is a “silent” condition. It typically doesn’t cause any symptoms. Many people don’t even realize they have high cholesterol until they develop serious complications, such as a heart attack or stroke.</p>\n<p>That’s why routine cholesterol screening is important. If you’re 20 years or older, ask your doctor if you should have routine cholesterol screening. Learn how this screening could potentially save your life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*w3X5HzuIrUKCInjE\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<h1>LDL cholesterol, or “bad cholesterol”</h1>\n<p>LDL cholesterol is often called “bad cholesterol.” It carries cholesterol to your arteries. If your levels of LDL cholesterol are too high, it can build up on the walls of your arteries.</p>\n<p>This buildup is also known as cholesterol plaque. This plaque can narrow your arteries, limit your blood flow, and raise your risk of blood clots. If a blood clot blocks an artery in your heart or brain, it can cause a heart attack or stroke.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*1K46opT61zXQyH7ArYfJmw.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<h1>HDL cholesterol, or “good cholesterol”</h1>\n<p>HDL cholesterol is sometimes called “good cholesterol.” It helps return LDL cholesterol to your liver to be removed from your body. This helps prevent cholesterol plaque from building up in your arteries.</p>\n<p>When you have healthy levels of HDL cholesterol, it can help lower your risk of blood clots, heart disease, and stroke.</p>\n<h1>Triglycerides, a different type of lipid</h1>\n<p>Triglycerides are another type of lipid. They’re different from cholesterol. While your body uses cholesterol to build cells and certain hormones, it uses triglycerides as a source of energy.</p>\n<p>When you eat more calories than your body can use right away, it converts those calories into triglycerides. It stores triglycerides in your fat cells. It also uses lipoproteins to circulate triglycerides through your bloodstream.</p>\n<p>If you regularly eat more calories than your body can use, your triglyceride levels may become too high. This can raise your risk of several health problems, including heart disease and stroke.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*wCGpJQFoOlIrOxns\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"528\" loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<h1>Getting your cholesterol levels checked</h1>\n<p>If you’re 20 years or older, it’s recommended getting your cholesterol levels checked at least once every 4 to 6 years. If you have a history of high cholesterol or other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, your doctor may encourage you to get your cholesterol levels tested more often.</p>\n<p>Your doctor can use a lipid panel to measure your total cholesterol level, as well your LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Your total cholesterol level is the overall amount of cholesterol in your blood. It includes LDL and HDL cholesterol.</p>\n<p>If your levels of total cholesterol or LDL cholesterol are too high, your doctor may diagnose you with high cholesterol.

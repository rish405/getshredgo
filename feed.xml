                <p>Women of reproductive age from the adolescent stage onwards start with hormonal fluctuations. These fluctuations might lead to various endocrine and metabolic disorders. PCOD or PCOS commonly known are metabolic disorders concerned with the ovaries.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">The ovary is a reproductive organ that changes its form, appearance, and shape according to its hormonal environment. But are PCOD and PCOS both the same? Let’s learn the differences between these two endocrine disorders.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Pr6J4SKW/engin-akyurt-q-U5-Fb-P-i8-I-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<h2><strong>What is PCOD?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>PCOD </strong>called Polycystic Ovarian Disease is a condition where the ovaries contain multiple immature eggs which later get converted into fluid-filled spaces called cysts. This condition is mainly hereditary and is passed from mothers through generations. The main underlying cause for this condition is a hormonal imbalance, especially an increase in the androgens (male hormones). It is a highly common condition and more prevalent in women of the age group 12-45 years.</p>
<p><strong>The clinical features of PCOD are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Irregular ovulation.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Obesity.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Alopecia or Male pattern baldness.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Irregular periods.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Difficulty in conception.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PCOS</strong> called Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome is a condition more severe than PCOD. <span class="gvxzyvdx aeinzg81 t7p7dqev gh25dzvf tb6i94ri gupuyl1y i2onq4tn b6ax4al1 gem102v4 ncib64c9 mrvwc6qr sx8pxkcf f597kf1v cpcgwwas m2nijcs8 hxfwr5lz k1z55t6l oog5qr5w tes86rjd pbevjfx6 ztn2w49o" dir="auto">The polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most common cause of infertility due to anovulation which affects 4-7% of women following criteria are sufficient for the diagnosis.oligo and/0r anovulation,clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries at ultrasound. </span>In this, the ovaries produce more male hormones, which leads to a higher number of non-functional follicles/cysts in the ovaries per cycle. The higher number of these cysts leads to anovulatory cycles, where a mature egg is not available for fertilization. This leads to infertility. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BnX6w2wd/linkedin-sales-solutions-VKJt1-EZHl-Ws-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>The clinical features of PCOS are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Enlarged and bulky ovaries with more than 10ml volume, leading to overproduction of androgens.</li>
<li aria-level="1">More than 12  follicles, each measuring 2 to 9 millimeters in diameter, organized around the lining of the ovary like a necklace.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Irregular or missing periods.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Heavy periods.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Acne.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Hair loss (male pattern baldness).</li>
<li aria-level="1">Android (Apple-shaped) type of obesity. </li>
<li aria-level="1">Infertility.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Insulin resistance.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Gestational diabetes.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Excess body-weight.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Hirsutism (excess hair growth on various parts of the body).</li>
</ul>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">PCOS, if left untreated, leads to other lifestyle disorders like obesity, type 2 diabetes and increase in blood cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>The physical changes seen in PCOS can severely affect the confidence or self-esteem of women and their body image that contributes to psychological disturbances like anxiety and depression. Another factor that also affects their mental health is the societal pressure to have children as they struggle hard to conceive.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/YCZ9cj5j/naomi-august-a-Lnq-Dp3-B3-YU-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<h2><strong>Understanding the difference between PCOD and PCOS</strong></h2>
<p>The exact reasons for these disorders are not known, but a few theories suggest a myriad of abnormalities. The abnormalities could be, low levels of hormones like progesterone due to infrequent ovulation, overproduction of androgens which could trigger insulin resistance and abnormal androgen levels that signals the over-production of follicles.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">PCOS is a metabolic syndrome, whereas PCOD is a milder condition that can improve with the right nutrition &amp; exercise.</p>
<p>Women with PCOS are at a higher risk for other comorbidities like insulin resistance, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders &amp; endometrial cancers.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">Symptoms of PCOS like excess facial hair, acne, weight gain are visible at an early age.</p>
<p>Women with PCOD do not have many issues getting pregnant as seeking medical advice can help drastically, but those with PCOS have a higher risk of infertility &amp; also risk of miscarriage.</p>
<p>Women with PCOD may ovulate despite having symptoms similar to that of PCOS. But in the latter condition, ovulation is hampered due to the severe hormonal imbalance.</p>
<p>Ovaries in PCOS are very bulky with high volume &amp; contain approximately 12-15 cysts. Ovaries with PCOD in contrast may not be very bulky and may contain around 5-8 cysts.</p>
<p>Lastly, PCOS is not as common as PCOD.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zfhfq8N7/thought-catalog-UK78i6v-K3sc-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>How to manage PCOS / PCOD Condition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Weight loss with an increase in fat-free mass is the mainstay for improvement of both PCOD &amp; PCOS according to the International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS.</li>
<li aria-level="1">As insulin resistance is mostly associated with PCOS, women should cut down on simple sugars &amp; rather include more whole foods rich in complex carbohydrates in their diet.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Weight loss will not just increase the chances of ovulation &amp; subsequent pregnancy, but also minimize the risk of miscarriage.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Regular physical activity &amp; a balanced diet can help in long-term weight management.</li>
<li aria-level="1">An appropriate and effective dietary recommendation is still a debate for PCOS. According to a few studies, dietary intake was assessed in women with PCOS, and it was found that these women consumed high glycemic index carbohydrates such as white bread and fried potatoes. Of all the popular diets, the Mediterranean diet promotes low GI carbohydrates, high fiber, unsaturated fats, vegetables and fruits (a rich source of vitamins and antioxidants) and is found to be effective in the management of various lifestyle disorders like insulin resistance, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia etc. Hence, it is also suggested for women with PCOS though this requires more supportive evidence. .</li>
<li aria-level="1">Lean women with PCOS should aim to maintain the bodyweight with consumption of a balanced diet as mentioned in the dietary recommendations. This can help with improving insulin resistance and overproduction of androgens.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Increasing the level of physical activity (either aerobic or anaerobic) aimed at reducing BMI, helps reduce the ovarian volume &amp; also the number of follicles.</li>
<li aria-level="1">A recent study has shown that high intensity aerobic activity of at least 3 days per week for 30 min or more per day with greater than or equal to 60% of VO2 max is advised to improve insulin resistance. Also, a combination workout that includes strength or resistance training thrice a week may help with managing the androgen levels.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Excess hair growth (hirsutism) due to PCOS/PCOD can be managed by various methods like laser hair removal treatment and the use of oral contraceptives to suppress androgen production.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Acne that is mild to moderate can be treated with topical applications like benzoyl peroxide or clindamycin creams.</li>
<li aria-level="1">For mental health in women with PCOS, physical exercise, in turn, group exercise has shown a  better outcome of quality of life.</li>

                <p>Despite the majority of the world concerned about weight loss techniques and gimmicks, we can't neglect the other side that is searching for the opposite. Despite the fact that obesity has been a problem for many people, there are also a lot of people who are suffering from underweight problems. The notion of exercise has always been associated with weight loss, but that is critical in the weight gain process as well. While gaining weight isn't all rainbow and sunshine, it requires a great deal of effort, and eating chocolate treats to boost healthy weight gain isn't exactly the solution to good eating. A healthy diet plan is the only real method to stay healthy and fit that may be achieved with only a good diet plan.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wMdT1JwG/christopher-campbell-k-FCdf-Lbu6z-A-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<p>We have created a diet chart for women to help them add weight in only seven days and a diet plan for weight gain. By eating the foods and meals listed, you'll be satisfied and won't experience any discomfort. All the local ingredients and spices will complement your Indian taste buds.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight  align-center"><strong>Why weight gain is as important as weight loss</strong></p>
<p>Obesity has become well-known and more common in the last few years, but being underweight has health risks and disadvantages as well. That makes it critical to be aware of weight gain, the proper, and healthy way. Poor nutrition and being underweight are associated with growth and development problems in younger children and teenagers, but adult subjects need to be on the lookout as well. Overeating skinnyness can lead to health difficulties like anaemia, diminished immune functionality, nutrient deficiencies, osteoporosis, and even raise the risk of future surgical complications.  Besides that, numerous mental issues can seep in as well, including eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, which is often connected with being underweight. To ensure you don’t consume junk foods or meals that have higher calorie counts, but follow a healthy diet plan for weight gain so that you may have a healthier and happier future.</p>
<p>If done properly, and with the <a href="https://getshredgo.net/best-online-personal-trainer-for-weight-loss-india/">guidance of a fitness coach</a>, weight gain of the body results in both muscle and fat weight increase. It is preferable to stay away from tasty, greasy food and look at whole grain and meals containing healthy fats instead.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight  align-center"><strong>8 tips to gain weight in a healthy way:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid drinking water before your meal. This habit can fill your stomach even before eating enough hence leading you to eat less nutritious food and be filled in liquid instead.</li>
<li>Add more eating hours. If you aren’t the type who can take heavy meals at once then keep snack breaks where you can munch on healthy and tasty foods.</li>
<li>Switch over to milk from carbonated drinks. Drinking whole milk is a great and simple way to incorporate high-quality protein and calories when you wish to quench your thirst. Choosing carbonated sugary drinks will only increase sugar levels in your body instead of doing it any good.</li>
<li>Though opting for all-natural things is always better trying weight gain shakes which are made from organic products is not a bad idea for that little extra calorie intake of the day.</li>
<li>Use larger plates. Eating in bigger plates makes sure you are taking meals in bigger proportions and the human psyche of finishing what is on your plate will guarantee you get the nutrients of that one full plate at least.</li>
<li>Getting good sleep is important as it helps in muscle growth which will further add muscle mass to your body as well.</li>
<li>Reducing stress should be our top priority as well, as stress can affect hormones and thus lead to change in appetite and metabolization.</li>
<li>Keep your proteins for first and vegetables for the last. When your plate is a mix of everything it's always better to eat calorie-dense foods like protein first and vegetables at the last of the meal so if you wish to leave anything out the lower calorie foods can be skipped.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tJtRWTfC/gursimrat-ganda-TT042b-Oytl-U-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight  align-center"><strong>List of healthy food items you can incorporate in your diet plan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Whole grains:</strong> Whole grain foods like bread, and cereals are packed with healthy complex carbohydrates, fibre, and various other nutrients.</li>
<li><strong>High-calorie foods:</strong> Taking starchy food like potato, corn, legumes, and more that are high in calories is a great way to boost the growth of muscles as well as helps in speeding up weight gain.</li>
<li><strong>Protein-rich foods/ meat:</strong> If non-vegetarian food works for you then it's advised to add leaner cuts in your diet which are healthier and will provide enough protein. So if you are a fan of seafood as well then going for a fish like salmon would be better than any other heavy fish like canned tuna. Or else for vegetarians, indulging in paneer, soya, chickpeas is a great option to get the required protein.</li>
<li><strong>Nuts and nut butters:</strong> Calorie-dense nuts are always a great option as they can be added to various dishes and are a healthy snack to munch on as well.</li>
<li><strong>Milk:</strong> For those who are looking for some muscle gain, milk can be an ideal choice. A balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats, is a complete meal in itself.</li>
<li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Be it dry fruits or raw natural fruits, incorporating them into your diet plan is always advised as they are rich in calories as well as nutrients.</li>
</ul>
<p>To smooth and simple weight gain journey, you should i<strong>ncrease 300-400 calories to your daily calorie intake</strong>, but 700 calories can be consumed for quicker results. You should gradually increase your daily calorie intake rather than consuming all fats at once. You should <strong>also include weight training</strong> to your daily routine along with a diet plan to accelerate your weight gain journey and obtain better, healthier outcomes.</p>
<p>Our 7-day diet chart for weight gain for females, which consists of 1400-1500 calories, is ideal for the majority and common as well. We will now discuss our diet plan for weight gain, which includes a non-veg as well as a vegetarian diet plan.</p>

                <h2><strong>Strength and conditioning drills</strong></h2>
<p>Strength and conditioning drills are a specialized form of workouts that use bodyweight exercises to improve overall strength, both physically and mentally. These types of workouts are not typical high-intensity cardio sessions that might leave you feeling sore for days. They are more about challenging your body in new ways and helping you overcome your mental barriers. This is beneficial because when you’re lifting weights and doing strength-focused exercises, you’re not putting too much pressure on your joints.</p>
<p>You’re also challenging your muscles in new ways and building stronger muscles — which is what you need to prevent injury and perform at your best. Having a personal trainer will allow you to do strength and conditioning drills to improve your overall strength and flexibility. You may have seen some of these exercises on social media — like the handstand, human flag, and one-legged squats.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">These are incredible workouts to build strength in your upper and lower body. Strength and conditioning drills are not only beneficial for athletic performance but also for mental health. These exercises can help manage stress, anxiety, and depression.</p>
<h2><strong>Nutrition plan</strong></h2>
<p>A good nutrition plan is key to achieving better results in fitness, as well as in other areas of your life. A nutrition plan created by a nutrition coach is specifically designed for your goals, timelines, and lifestyle. It takes into account any allergies, intolerances, or dietary restrictions you might have.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">A nutrition coach will take all of that information into account and create a custom-tailored meal plan that fits your specific needs and your desired outcome. A good nutrition plan will include healthy, whole foods and balanced meal portions to fuel your body with the right nutrients it needs, as well as healthy snacks to keep you satiated throughout the day.</p>
<p>A nutrition coach will also be able to identify any eating habits that might be sabotaging your results or that might not be the best for your overall health. They will then create a plan to help you overcome those eating habits and work towards a healthier lifestyle.</p>
<h2><strong>Accountability</strong></h2>
<p>Working out with a personal trainer will hold you accountable to your fitness journey. When you have a trainer, you’re not just paying them for them to give you a workout plan and leave; you’re paying them to stay with you throughout your whole journey and help you get to where you want to be. They are there to support you in both your good and bad times.</p>
<p>They are there to encourage you when you feel like you want to give up and push you to keep going when you feel like you can’t go any further. A personal trainer will also know what to say at the right time to keep you accountable and help you stay on track. They will know what to say to boost your energy when you’re feeling tired and what to say to help keep you motivated when you feel like you want to give up.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">Working out with a personal trainer can help you stay accountable when you might normally give up and leave the gym after one or two workouts.</p>
<h2><strong>Confidence builder</strong></h2>
<p>Depending on the type of personal trainer you choose, working out with them can help build your confidence in many different ways. Confidence is not something that is built overnight, but it is something that can be built through consistent, daily actions. A personal trainer will challenge you both physically and mentally to push you outside of your comfort zone and help you become a better version of yourself.</p>
<p>They will push you in your workouts and help you improve your strength, endurance, and overall fitness level. A personal trainer will understand what you’re hoping to achieve with your workouts and help you get there even faster, giving you more confidence along the way.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">Working out with a personal trainer can help build your confidence in many different ways: It can help you build your self-esteem, strengthen your mental health, and boost your energy level.</p>
<h2><strong>Better tracking of progress</strong></h2>
<p>A personal trainer will not only push you in your workouts, but they will also track your progress and make sure you’re progressing at the right pace. They will also be able to help you identify areas you need to improve on and help you stay accountable for those goals. They will help you stay on track with your workouts, as well as your diet plan.</p>
<p>You might have seen those posts on social media from friends who are trying to lose weight or gain muscle, with the caption: “Day 1!” It’s nice that they are trying to stay accountable for their goals, but sometimes it can be tough to follow along with someone who isn’t a professional. Working out with a personal trainer will allow you to track your progress and get feedback from an expert.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">They will be able to help you track your progress with your workouts, as well as help you identify areas you need to improve on and stay on track with those goals.</p>
<h2><strong>Better performance</strong></h2>
<p>Working out with a personal trainer will allow them to assess your fitness level and help you improve your performance and reach new fitness goals. Depending on your fitness level, a personal trainer will help you track your progress and challenge you to meet your fitness goals. They will make sure you are performing the exercises at the right intensity level.</p>
<p>They will also help you develop a better fitness routine based on your goals and specific fitness level. You might have specific performance goals you want to achieve, like completing a certain distance in a marathon or completing a certain time in a certain race.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">A personal trainer can help you reach those goals by tracking your progress, giving you the right advice, and challenging you to push yourself further than you thought you could.</p>
<h2><strong>Better body composition</strong></h2>
<p>Working out with a personal trainer is beneficial because they will be able to help you track your progress towards better body composition. Body composition refers to the ratio between your fat and muscle mass. You might have the same weight, but the composition of that weight might be different because of the types of muscles being developed.</p>

<p class="msg msg--highlight ">A personal trainer will create an effective workout routine for you to strengthen your weak areas and help you prevent injury. They will also be there to push you in your workouts and help you improve your overall fitness level.</p>
<h2><strong>Better sleep</strong></h2>
<p>Working out with a personal trainer will allow you to meet your fitness goals while also improving your sleep.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">Exercising at the right time can help you get a better night’s sleep. As you get closer to bed time, your body begins to release certain hormones that help you fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night.</p>
<p>Exercising too close to bedtime, however, can cause your body to release the wrong type of hormones — which can disrupt your sleep and keep you awake at night. A personal trainer will be able to help you schedule your workouts at the right time and type of workout to help you get better sleep.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Having a personal trainer on your side is like having an additional nutrition coach. They are there to push you in your workouts and help you stay accountable for sticking to your diet plan. Having a personal trainer will allow you to track your progress towards better body composition, better performance, and better sleep.</p>
<p>A personal trainer will also be able to help you prevent injury, track your progress towards a better sleep, and help you better manage your stress levels.</p>

                    <img src="https://getshredgo.net/media/posts/8/sam-moghadam-khamseh-Oxpa8sZwGNU-unsplash.jpg" alt="" />
                <p>Are you a vegan or vegetarian , aspiring to keep your body fit with the help of Keto diet? Keto diet is normally associated with fish, meat,foul flesh, etc. In Fact a lot of people think that the keto diet is imperfect without all of this.Due to this reason, most of the Indians quit their thought of going for a Keto Diet.<br><br>A lot of research has been done which shows that a vegetarian diet is the healthiest diet of all. A vegetarian diet is much healthier than a non vegetarian diet and it also helps in curing a lot of diseases related to heart and diabetes. Thus, having an Indian keto diet plan for vegans &amp; vegetarians stands no less than a non- vegetarian keto diet plan. </p>
<h3><strong>What is an Indian Keto Diet Plan ?</strong></h3>
<p class="msg msg--highlight ">Our main objective is to reduce the carbon footprint, reduce animal abuse and stay healthy. We have to train a body such that it utilizes fats as a source of energy instead of carbohydrates. That is the reason why the keto diet plan is a low carbohydrate plan. </p>
<p>Carbohydrate is the primary source of energy and when we reduce the intake of carbohydrate the body automatically takes energy from other sources of the body. Eventually the body has to break down fat to convert it into energy. With more consumption and breakdown of fat, the body loses the weight very quickly.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">The composition of an Indian Keto Diet Plan for vegans &amp; vegetarians will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carbohydrates :10-15%</li>
<li>Fats: 65%</li>
<li>Proteins : 25%</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>9 Rules to follow the</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Indian Keto Diet Plan</strong></h3>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Reduce Carbohydrates</strong></p>
<p>Include high fibre content in your diet and reduce foods such as pulses, cereals, legumes and quinoa which are rich in carbohydrates. Do not consume more than 20 grams of carbohydrates per day. </p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Include digestible fats</strong></p>
<p>Include butter, coconut oil, milk,cheese,semi hard cheese, cottage cheese,almond butter, peanut butter, ghee,cream,yogurt,etc. in the form of digestible fats. </p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Avoid sweeteners</strong></p>
<p>Avoid all kinds of artificial sweeteners which are full of chemicals and bleaches. Also  avoid sugar in the form of honey, maple syrup, agave,etc. in your diet. </p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Include Multivitamins</strong></p>
<p>Use multivitamins if required such as Omega 3, Calcium, multivitamin capsules, deficiency capsules,etc. </p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Include Proteins</strong></p>
<p>Proteins consist of amino acids which are very essential for the human body. One should have at least 70 grams of protein per day. Include nutritional yeast, eggs, tofu, natto etc. in your diet plan. Egg, yoghurt and hemp seeds are the best sources of protein. Eggs contain digestible proteins and is also good for brain functioning.</p>
<p>Yogurt is an excellent source of calcium magnesium and potassium and it also helps with good immunity.  Hemp seeds are rich in fibre and a great source of magnesium, potassium and Omega 3 fatty acids. </p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Eat Non-Starchy Vegetables </strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of vegetables which are rich in fibre and have a good amount of multi nutrients. Spinach, Cauliflower, Sprouts, Avocado, Zucchini, mushrooms, broccoli, kale and bell peppers are non starchy vegetables. These vegetables contain vitamin C, potassium ,Vitamin B6 ,magnesium and folate.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Seeds and Nuts</strong></p>
<p>Almonds, flax seeds, Chia seeds, Walnuts, dark chocolates, hemp seeds, Pumpkin seeds, unsweetened cocoa,etc. comes under a healthy ketogenic diet. </p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Herbs and Seasoning</strong></p>
<p>Seasoning the food with good herbs provides a nice flavour, texture and aroma to the vegetarian food. Herbs such as Basil, pepper, turmeric, cinnamon, rosemary, salt, oregano, etc. are good for digestion. </p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Use healthy Oil</strong></p>
<p>Healthy fats help you to stay full for long hours. They are necessary for various vitamins such as A, D, K and E. Since fats are converted into energy in a keto diet, it is very important to pick the right ones. </p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Coconut Oil</strong> provides a lot of fatty acids which is an ideal fuel source of keto dieters.It can be used in cooking, baking, applying directly on the body and desserts.</p>
<p class="msg msg--success"><strong>Olive Oil</strong> is the healthiest of all the oils. Best type of olive oil is extra virgin olive oil. Keto dieter should use extra virgin olive oil for cooking, baking, frying and even for applying on the body. </p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Avocado Oil </strong>contains a lot of monounsaturated fats. It has a high smoke point, thus perfect for cooking and baking purposes. </p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>MCT Oil </strong>is derived from coconut oil and palm oil. It contains a chain of triglycerides, which are saturated fatty acids. It skips normal fat digestion and hits directly to the liver where they are converted into ketones for fuel. It is used in salad dressings, sauces, smoothies, and hot drinks like coffee or tea.</p>

                <p class="graf graf--p">Whether you want to lose weight for a special occasion or simply improve your health, weight loss is a common goal.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">To set realistic expectations, you may want to know what a healthy weight loss rate is.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This article explains the factors that affect how long it may take you to lose weight.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*NepXHJG7AoK2CyHE" data-image-id="0*NepXHJG7AoK2CyHE" data-width="4680" data-height="3120" data-unsplash-photo-id="lrQPTQs7nQQ" data-is-featured="true"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Weight loss occurs when you consistently consume fewer calories than you burn each day.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Conversely, weight gain happens when you consistently eat more calories than you burn.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Any food or beverage you consume that has calories counts toward your overall calorie intake.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">That said, the number of calories you burn each day, which is known as energy or calorie expenditure, is a bit more complicated.</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Resting metabolic rate (RMR)- </strong>This is the number of calories your body needs to maintain normal bodily functions, such as breathing and pumping blood.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Thermic effect of food (TEF) -</strong>This refers to the calories used to digest, absorb, and metabolise food.</li>
<li class="graf graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Thermic effect of activity (TEA) -</strong>These are the calories you use during exercise. TEA can also include non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), which accounts for the calories used for activities like yard work and fidgeting.</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf graf--p">If the number of calories you consume equals the number of calories you burn, you maintain your body weight.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">If you want to lose weight, you must create a negative calorie balance by consuming fewer calories than you burn or burning more calories through increased activity.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*2IADS9BPZ8vAPtHm" data-image-id="0*2IADS9BPZ8vAPtHm" data-width="5632" data-height="3755" data-unsplash-photo-id="5jctAMjz21A"></figure></figure>
<blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Weight loss occurs when you consistently consume fewer calories than you burn each day.</em></blockquote>
<p class="graf graf--p">Several factors affect the rate at which you lose weight. Many of them are out of your control.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Gender</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Your fat-to-muscle ratio greatly affects your ability to lose weight.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Because women typically have a greater fat-to-muscle ratio than men, they have a 5–10% lower RMR than men of the same height. Yet, while men tended to lose weight quicker than women, the study didn’t analyze gender-based differences in the ability to maintain weight loss.</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Age</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">One of the many bodily changes that occur with aging is alterations in body composition — fat mass increases and muscle mass decreases.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">This change, along with other factors like the declining calorie needs of your major organs, contributes to a lower RMR</p>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Starting point</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Your initial body mass and composition may also affect how quickly you can expect to lose weight.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">It’s important to understand that different absolute weight losses (in pounds) can correspond to the same relative (%) weight loss in different individuals. Ultimately, weight loss is a complex process.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Although a heavier person may lose double the amount of weight, a person with less weight may lose an equal percentage of their body weight (10/250 = 4% versus 5/125 = 4%).</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, a person weighing 300 pounds (136 kg) may lose 10 pounds (4.5 kg) after reducing their daily intake by 1,000 calories and increasing physical activity for 2 weeks.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Z-7_8zmgL7UTcQYb" data-image-id="0*Z-7_8zmgL7UTcQYb" data-width="7337" data-height="5503" data-unsplash-photo-id="2q-c_xUtjh0"></figure></figure>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Calorie deficit</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">You must create a negative calorie balance to lose weight. The extent of this calorie deficit affects how quickly you lose weight.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">For example, consuming 500 fewer calories per day for 8 weeks will likely result in greater weight loss than eating 200 fewer calories per day.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">However, be sure not to make your calorie deficit too large.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Doing so would not only be unsustainable but also put you at risk for nutrient deficiencies. What’s more, it might make you more likely to lose weight in the form of muscle mass rather than fat mass.</p>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Xg_yTeW7xC7vZIGP" data-image-id="0*Xg_yTeW7xC7vZIGP" data-width="6000" data-height="4000" data-unsplash-photo-id="rUc9hVE-L-E"></figure></figure>
<h3 class="graf graf--h3">Sleep</h3>
<p class="graf graf--p">Sleep tends to be an overlooked yet crucial component of weight loss.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Chronic sleep loss can significantly hinder weight loss and the speed at which you shed pounds.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Just one night of sleep deprivation has been shown to increase your desire for high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods, such as cookies, cakes, sugary beverages, and chips.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">One 2-week study randomized participants on a calorie-restricted diet to sleep either 5.5 or 8.5 hours each night.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Those who slept 5.5 hours lost 55% less body fat and 60% more lean body mass than those who slept 8.5 hours per night</p>
<blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Age, gender, and sleep are just a few of the many factors that affect weight loss. Others include some medical conditions, your genetics, and the use of certain medications.</em></blockquote>
<figure class="graf graf--figure"><figure class="graf-image"><img  src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*FbK-0fT-jB8YyUrm" data-image-id="0*FbK-0fT-jB8YyUrm" data-width="6000" data-height="4000" data-unsplash-photo-id="5ddH9Y2accI"></figure></figure>
<p class="graf graf--p">Though weight loss may occur faster at the start of a program, experts recommend a weight loss of 1–3 pounds (0.45–1.36 kg) per week, or about 1% of your body weight.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Also, keep in mind that weight loss is not a linear process. Some weeks you may lose more, while other weeks you may lose less or none at all.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">So don’t be discouraged if your weight loss slows or plateaus for a few days.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Using a food diary, as well as weighing yourself regularly, may help you stay on track.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Research shows that people who employ self-monitoring techniques, such as recording your dietary intake and weight, are more successful at losing weight and keeping it off than those who don’t.</p>
<blockquote class="graf graf--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Losing weight too quickly can lead to problems like gallstones, muscle loss, and extreme fatigue. Experts recommend a moderate weight loss of 1–3 pounds (0.45–1.36 kg) per week, or about 1% of your body weight.</em></blockquote>
<p class="graf graf--p">Weight loss occurs when you eat fewer calories than you burn.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p">Many factors affect your <a href="https://getshredgo.net" data-href="https://getshredgo.net" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">weight loss rate</a>, including your gender, age, starting weight, sleep, and the extent of your calorie deficit.</p>

<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>Foods to eat in Hypothyroidism</strong></p>
<p>Here are a few lists of food items to manage your hypothyroidism and improve your overall health.</p>
<p><strong>1. Iodized Salt</strong>: Hypothyroidism causes an iodine deficiency in the body leading to thyroid disorder. Lack of iodine in your body could be the cause of your hypothyroidism. Flavour your food with some iodized salt to restore your iodine levels for balancing your overall diet.</p>
<p><strong>2. Brazil or Hazel nuts:</strong> Brazil or Hazel nuts are rich sources of selenium that can help in the converting the inactive thyroid hormones to its active form thus improving the function of the thyroid gland.</p>
<p><strong>3. Bone Broth:</strong> Hypothyroidism causes the bones to weaken. Bone broth is the clear and protein-rich liquid which is prepared by simmering meaty joints and bones in water. It strengthens your bones as it has amino acids and collagen which manages the weight, thus managing hypothyroidism.</p>
<p><strong>4. Fish and shellfish:</strong> Fatty fish contain high amounts of Omega-3 fatty acids and selenium that helps in controlling the cholesterol levels and helps in the normal functioning of the thyroid gland. Eat fishes like salmon, tuna, sardine, etc. and grill them.</p>
<p><strong>5. Olive Oil:</strong> Olive oil is rich in healthy fats and should be used to prepare meals for hypothyroid diet. It lowers the LDL cholesterol keeping your heart healthy. Also, meals prepared in olive oil can keep you full for long thus reducing your appetite too.</p>
<p><strong>6. Dairy:</strong> Low-fat dairy products such as Greek yoghurt, cheese and low-fat milk are good for your body while trying to manage hypothyroidism. It boosts iodine production in short and long term.</p>
<p><strong>7. Eggs:</strong> Eggs each day are excellent for breakfast in hypothyroidism people. Eggs are a rich source of protein and also contain fat-soluble vitamins. They boost the iodine levels in the body. You feel full for a longer time and would avoid reaching out for unhealthy or junk foods.</p>

                <p>Here are some science-backed tips to help you lose weight that include healthy eating, choosing carbs carefully, and that aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduce your appetite and hunger levels while keeping you satisfied</li>
<li>produce consistent weight loss over time</li>
<li>help improve your metabolic health at the same time</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to lose weight quickly, some of these tips may help, but quick weight loss is rarely sustainable. Focusing on long-term health and habits that you can stick with over time will help improve your health and are more likely to result in lasting weight loss.</p>
<h2>1. Cut back on refined carbs</h2>
<p>One way to help lose weight quickly is to cut back on sugars and starches, or carbohydrates. <span class="randomColor3" data-name="this could|this might" data-org="this might"> this might </span> be with a low carb eating plan or by reducing refined carbs and replacing them with whole grains. <br><br>When you do that, your hunger levels go down, and you generally <span class="randomColor1" data-name="end up|find yourself" data-org="find yourself"> find yourself </span> eating fewer calories. <br><br>With <span class="randomColor3" data-name="a low|a coffee|an occasional" data-org="a coffee"> a coffee </span> carb eating plan, you’ll utilize burning stored fat for energy <span class="randomColor5" data-name="instead of|rather than" data-org="rather than"> rather than </span> carbs. <br><br>If <span class="randomColor1" data-name="you choose|you select|you decide on" data-org="you select"> you select </span> to eat more complex carbs like whole grains along with a calorie deficit, you’ll <span class="randomColor3" data-name="benefit from|enjoy|take pleasure in|like|get pleasure from|have the benefit of" data-org="enjoy"> enjoy </span> higher fiber and digest them more slowly. This makes them more filling <span class="randomColor5" data-name="to keep|to stay" data-org="to stay"> to stay </span> you satisfied.</p>

<h2>2. Eat protein, fat, and vegetables</h2>
<p>Aim to include a variety of foods at each meal. To balance your plate and help you lose weight your meals should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a protein source</li>
<li>fat source</li>
<li>vegetables</li>
<li>a small portion of complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains</li>
</ul>
<h2><figure class="is-loaded"><img  src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598515214211-89d3c73ae83b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2070&amp;q=80" alt="" width="2070" height="1380" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h2>
<p> </p>
<h2>Protein</h2>
<p>Eating a recommended amount of protein is essential to help preserve your health and muscle mass while losing weight</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that eating adequate protein may improve cardiometabolic risk factors, appetite, and body weight</p>
<p>Generally, an average male needs about 56–91 grams per day, and the average female needs 46–75 grams per day, but many factors influence protein needs. Here are guidelines to help you figure out how much protein to eat without eating too much</p>
<ul>
<li>0.8g/kg of body weight</li>
<li>1–1.2g/kg of body weight for people 65 and older</li>
<li>1.4–2g/kg of body weight for athletes</li>
</ul>
<p>Diets with adequate protein may also help you reduce cravings and snacking by helping you feel full and satisfied.</p>
<h2><figure class="is-loaded"><img  src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1587996597484-04743eeb56b4?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1287&amp;q=80" alt="" width="1287" height="1931" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h2>
<h2>Healthy protein sources include:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong class="kh jj">meat:</strong> beef, chicken, pork, and lamb</li>
<li><strong class="kh jj">fish and seafood:</strong> salmon, trout, sardines, and shrimp</li>
<li><strong class="kh jj">eggs</strong></li>
<li><strong class="kh jj">plant-based proteins:</strong> beans, legumes, quinoa, tempeh, and tofu</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vegetables</h2>
<p>Don’t be afraid to load your plate with leafy green vegetables. They’re packed with nutrients, and you can eat very large amounts without greatly increasing calories and carbs.</p>
<p>All vegetables are nutrient-rich and healthy foods to add to your diet, but some vegetables, like potatoes, sweet potatoes, winter squash, and corn, are higher in carbs.</p>
<p>These vegetables are considered complex carbs because they contain fiber, but you may want to be mindful of serving size when adding these vegetables to your plate.</p>
<h2><figure class="is-loaded"><img  src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1604908817381-f14a28de5347?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1780&amp;q=80" alt="" width="1780" height="1780" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h2>
<h2>Vegetables to include more of:</h2>
<ul>
<li>broccoli</li>
<li>cauliflower</li>
<li>spinach</li>
<li>tomatoes</li>
<li>kale</li>
<li>Brussels sprouts</li>
<li>cabbage</li>
<li>Swiss chard</li>
<li>lettuce</li>
<li>cucumber</li>
<li>peppers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Healthy fats</h2>
<p>Don’t be afraid of eating fats.</p>
<p>Your body still requires healthy fats no matter what eating plan you choose. Olive oil and avocado oil are great choices for including in your eating plan. Nuts, seeds, olives, and avocados are delicious and healthy additions, as well.</p>
<p>Other fats such as butter and coconut oil should be used only in moderation due to their higher saturated fat content</p>
<h2><figure class="is-loaded"><img  src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1608138404239-d2f557515ecb?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2070&amp;q=80" alt="" width="2070" height="1380" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h2>
<h2>3. Move your body</h2>
<p>Exercise, while not required to lose weight, can help you lose weight more quickly. Lifting weights has particularly good benefits.</p>
<p>By lifting weights, you’ll burn calories and help prevent your metabolism from slowing down, which is a common side effect of losing weight.</p>
<p>Try strength training three to four times a week. If you’re new to lifting weights, a trainer may be able to help you get started. Make sure your doctor is also aware of any new exercise plans.</p>
<p>If lifting weights is not an option for you, doing some cardio workouts such as walking, jogging, running, cycling, or swimming is very beneficial for weight loss and general health.</p>

                <h3>Intermittent fasting (IF) is currently one of the world’s most popular health and fitness trends.</h3>
<p>People are using it to lose weight, improve their health and simplify their lifestyles.</p>
<p>Many studies show that it can have powerful effects on your body and brain and may even help you live longer.</p>
<p>This is the ultimate beginner’s guide to intermittent fasting.</p>
<h1><figure class="is-loaded"><img  src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*qOq0qMHRgzoLXu-A" alt="" width="1400" height="807" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h1>
<h3>What Is Intermittent Fasting (IF)?</h3>
<p>Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.</p>
<p>It doesn’t specify which foods you should eat but rather <em class="mw">when</em> you should eat them.</p>
<p>In this respect, it’s not a diet in the conventional sense but more accurately described as an eating pattern.</p>
<p>Common intermittent fasting methods involve daily 16-hour fasts or fasting for 24 hours, twice per week.</p>
<p>Fasting has been a practice throughout human evolution. Ancient hunter-gatherers didn’t have supermarkets, refrigerators or food available year-round. Sometimes they couldn’t find anything to eat.</p>
<p>As a result, humans evolved to be able to function without food for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>In fact, fasting from time to time is more natural than always eating 3–4 (or more) meals per day.</p>
<p>Fasting is also often done for religious or spiritual reasons, including in Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism.</p>
<h1><figure class="is-loaded"><img  src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*d0nGsMwHS2O5GPBV" alt="" width="1400" height="927" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h1>
<h3>Intermittent Fasting Methods</h3>
<p>There are several different ways of doing intermittent fasting — all of which involve splitting the day or week into eating and fasting periods.</p>
<p>During the fasting periods, you eat either very little or nothing at all.</p>
<p>These are the most popular methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="ks jj">The 16/8 method:</strong> Also called the Leangains protocol, it involves skipping breakfast and restricting your daily eating period to 8 hours, such as 1–9 p.m. Then you fast for 16 hours in between.</li>
<li><strong class="ks jj">Eat-Stop-Eat:</strong> This involves fasting for 24 hours, once or twice a week, for example by not eating from dinner one day until dinner the next day.</li>
<li><strong class="ks jj">The 5:2 diet:</strong> With this method, you consume only 500–600 calories on two nonconsecutive days of the week, but eat normally the other 5 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>By reducing your calorie intake, all of these methods should cause weight loss as long as you don’t compensate by eating much more during the eating periods.</p>
<p>Many people find the 16/8 method to be the simplest, most sustainable and easiest to stick to. It’s also the most popular.</p>

<h3>How It Affects Your Cells and Hormones</h3>
<p>When you fast, several things happen in your body on the cellular and molecular level.</p>
<p>For example, your body adjusts hormone levels to make stored body fat more accessible.</p>
<p>Your cells also initiate important repair processes and change the expression of genes.</p>
<p>Here are some changes that occur in your body when you fast:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="ks jj">Human Growth Hormone (HGH):</strong> The levels of growth hormone skyrocket, increasing as much as 5-fold. This has benefits for fat loss and muscle gain, to name a few.</li>
<li><strong class="ks jj">Insulin:</strong> Insulin sensitivity improves and levels of insulin drop dramatically. Lower insulin levels make stored body fat more accessible.</li>
<li><strong class="ks jj">Cellular repair:</strong> When fasted, your cells initiate cellular repair processes. This includes autophagy, where cells digest and remove old and dysfunctional proteins that build up inside cells.</li>
<li><strong class="ks jj">Gene expression:</strong> There are changes in the function of genes related to longevity and protection against disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes in hormone levels, cell function and gene expression are responsible for the health benefits of intermittent fasting.</p>

<h3>Health Benefits</h3>
<p>Many studies have been done on intermittent fasting, in both animals and humans.</p>
<p>These studies have shown that it can have powerful benefits for weight control and the health of your body and brain. It may even help you live longer.</p>
<p>Here are the main health benefits of intermittent fasting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="ks jj">Weight loss:</strong> As mentioned above, intermittent fasting can help you lose weight and belly fat, without having to consciously restrict calories.</li>
<li><strong class="ks jj">Insulin resistance:</strong> Intermittent fasting can reduce insulin resistance, lowering blood sugar by 3–6% and fasting insulin levels by 20–31%, which should protect against type 2 diabetes (1).</li>
<li><strong class="ks jj">Inflammation:</strong> Some studies show reductions in markers of inflammation, a key driver of many chronic diseases.</li>
<li><strong class="ks jj">Heart health:</strong> Intermittent fasting may reduce “bad” LDL cholesterol, blood triglycerides, inflammatory markers, blood sugar and insulin resistance — all risk factors for heart disease.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Makes Your Healthy Lifestyle Simpler</h3>
<p>Eating healthy is simple, but it can be incredibly hard to maintain.</p>
<p>One of the main obstacles is all the work required to plan for and cook healthy meals.</p>
<p>Intermittent fasting can make things easier, as you don’t need to plan, cook or clean up after as many meals as before.</p>
<p>For this reason, intermittent fasting is very popular among the life-hacking crowd, as it improves your health while simplifying your life at the same time.</p>

<h3>Safety and Side Effects</h3>
<p>Hunger is the main side effect of intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>You may also feel weak and your brain may not perform as well as you’re used to.</p>
<p>This may only be temporary, as it can take some time for your body to adapt to the new meal schedule.</p>
<p>If you have a medical condition, you should consult with your doctor before trying intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>This is particularly important if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have diabetes.</li>
<li>Have problems with blood sugar regulation.</li>
<li>Have low blood pressure.</li>
<li>Take medications.</li>
<li>Are underweight.</li>
<li>Have a history of eating disorders.</li>
<li>Are a woman who is trying to conceive.</li>
<li>Are a woman with a history of amenorrhea.</li>
<li>Are pregnant or breastfeeding.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that being said, intermittent fasting has an outstanding safety profile. There is nothing dangerous about not eating for a while if you’re healthy and well-nourished overall.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>Here are answers to the most common questions about intermittent fasting.</p>
<h4 id="b88b" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">1. Can I Drink Liquids During the Fast?</h4>
<p>Yes. Water, coffee, tea and other non-caloric beverages are fine. Do not add sugar to your coffee. Small amounts of milk or cream may be okay.</p>
<p>Coffee can be particularly beneficial during a fast, as it can blunt hunger.</p>
<h4 id="a98e" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">2. Isn’t It Unhealthy to Skip Breakfast?</h4>
<p>No. The problem is that most stereotypical breakfast skippers have unhealthy lifestyles. If you make sure to eat healthy food for the rest of the day then the practice is perfectly healthy.</p>
<h4 id="7dc6" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">3. Can I Take Supplements While Fasting?</h4>
<p>Yes. However, keep in mind that some supplements like fat-soluble vitamins may work better when taken with meals.</p>
<h4 id="3f0e" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">4. Can I Work out While Fasted?</h4>
<p>Yes, fasted workouts are fine. Some people recommend taking branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) before a fasted workout.</p>
<h4 id="6346" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">5. Will Fasting Cause Muscle Loss?</h4>
<p>All weight loss methods can cause muscle loss, which is why it’s important to lift weights and keep your protein intake high. One study showed that intermittent fasting causes less muscle loss than regular calorie restriction.</p>
<h4 id="2cff" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">6. Will Fasting Slow Down My Metabolism?</h4>
<p>No. Studies show that short-term fasts actually boost metabolism. However, longer fasts of 3 or more days can suppress metabolism.</p>
<h4 id="b7f2" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">7. Should Kids Fast?</h4>
<p>Allowing your child to fast is probably a bad idea.</p>

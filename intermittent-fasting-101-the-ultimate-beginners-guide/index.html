Ancient hunter-gatherers didn’t have supermarkets, refrigerators or food available year-round. Sometimes they couldn’t find anything to eat.</p><p>As a result, humans evolved to be able to function without food for extended periods of time.</p><p>In fact, fasting from time to time is more natural than always eating 3–4 (or more) meals per day.</p><p>Fasting is also often done for religious or spiritual reasons, including in Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism.</p><h1><figure class="is-loaded"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*d0nGsMwHS2O5GPBV" alt="" width="1400" height="927" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h1><h3>Intermittent Fasting Methods</h3><p>There are several different ways of doing intermittent fasting — all of which involve splitting the day or week into eating and fasting periods.</p><p>During the fasting periods, you eat either very little or nothing at all.</p><p>These are the most popular methods:</p><ul><li><strong class="ks jj">The 16/8 method:</strong> Also called the Leangains protocol, it involves skipping breakfast and restricting your daily eating period to 8 hours, such as 1–9 p.m. Then you fast for 16 hours in between.</li><li><strong class="ks jj">Eat-Stop-Eat:</strong> This involves fasting for 24 hours, once or twice a week, for example by not eating from dinner one day until dinner the next day.</li><li><strong class="ks jj">The 5:2 diet:</strong> With this method, you consume only 500–600 calories on two nonconsecutive days of the week, but eat normally the other 5 days.</li></ul><p>By reducing your calorie intake, all of these methods should cause weight loss as long as you don’t compensate by eating much more during the eating periods.</p><p>Many people find the 16/8 method to be the simplest, most sustainable and easiest to stick to. It’s also the most popular.</p><h1><figure class="is-loaded"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*vZudnmIUJlyxG0XH" alt="" width="1400" height="933" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h1><h3>How It Affects Your Cells and Hormones</h3><p>When you fast, several things happen in your body on the cellular and molecular level.</p><p>For example, your body adjusts hormone levels to make stored body fat more accessible.</p><p>Your cells also initiate important repair processes and change the expression of genes.</p><p>Here are some changes that occur in your body when you fast:</p><ul><li><strong class="ks jj">Human Growth Hormone (HGH):</strong> The levels of growth hormone skyrocket, increasing as much as 5-fold. This has benefits for fat loss and muscle gain, to name a few.</li><li><strong class="ks jj">Insulin:</strong> Insulin sensitivity improves and levels of insulin drop dramatically. Lower insulin levels make stored body fat more accessible.</li><li><strong class="ks jj">Cellular repair:</strong> When fasted, your cells initiate cellular repair processes. This includes autophagy, where cells digest and remove old and dysfunctional proteins that build up inside cells.</li><li><strong class="ks jj">Gene expression:</strong> There are changes in the function of genes related to longevity and protection against disease.</li></ul><p>These changes in hormone levels, cell function and gene expression are responsible for the health benefits of intermittent fasting.</p><h1><figure class="is-loaded"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*nZyKxXzMaUYSN00P" alt="" width="1400" height="787" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h1><h3>Health Benefits</h3><p>Many studies have been done on intermittent fasting, in both animals and humans.</p><p>These studies have shown that it can have powerful benefits for weight control and the health of your body and brain. It may even help you live longer.</p><p>Here are the main health benefits of intermittent fasting:</p><ul><li><strong class="ks jj">Weight loss:</strong> As mentioned above, intermittent fasting can help you lose weight and belly fat, without having to consciously restrict calories.</li><li><strong class="ks jj">Insulin resistance:</strong> Intermittent fasting can reduce insulin resistance, lowering blood sugar by 3–6% and fasting insulin levels by 20–31%, which should protect against type 2 diabetes (1).</li><li><strong class="ks jj">Inflammation:</strong> Some studies show reductions in markers of inflammation, a key driver of many chronic diseases.</li><li><strong class="ks jj">Heart health:</strong> Intermittent fasting may reduce “bad” LDL cholesterol, blood triglycerides, inflammatory markers, blood sugar and insulin resistance — all risk factors for heart disease.</li></ul><h1><figure class="is-loaded"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*oYEnmXbIyfhGK5dj" alt="" width="1400" height="844" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h1><h3>Makes Your Healthy Lifestyle Simpler</h3><p>Eating healthy is simple, but it can be incredibly hard to maintain.</p><p>One of the main obstacles is all the work required to plan for and cook healthy meals.</p><p>Intermittent fasting can make things easier, as you don’t need to plan, cook or clean up after as many meals as before.</p><p>For this reason, intermittent fasting is very popular among the life-hacking crowd, as it improves your health while simplifying your life at the same time.</p><h1><figure class="is-loaded"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*RiFOyEzD5dfjmqAq" alt="" width="1400" height="1120" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h1><h3>Safety and Side Effects</h3><p>Hunger is the main side effect of intermittent fasting.</p><p>You may also feel weak and your brain may not perform as well as you’re used to.</p><p>This may only be temporary, as it can take some time for your body to adapt to the new meal schedule.</p><p>If you have a medical condition, you should consult with your doctor before trying intermittent fasting.</p><p>This is particularly important if you:</p><ul><li>Have diabetes.</li><li>Have problems with blood sugar regulation.</li><li>Have low blood pressure.</li><li>Take medications.</li><li>Are underweight.</li><li>Have a history of eating disorders.</li><li>Are a woman who is trying to conceive.</li><li>Are a woman with a history of amenorrhea.</li><li>Are pregnant or breastfeeding.</li></ul><p>All that being said, intermittent fasting has an outstanding safety profile. There is nothing dangerous about not eating for a while if you’re healthy and well-nourished overall.</p><h1><figure class="is-loaded"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*UqeirOWkzaxKzO9V" alt="" width="1400" height="933" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></h1><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p>Here are answers to the most common questions about intermittent fasting.</p><h4 id="b88b" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">1. Can I Drink Liquids During the Fast?</h4><p>Yes. Water, coffee, tea and other non-caloric beverages are fine. Do not add sugar to your coffee. Small amounts of milk or cream may be okay.</p><p>Coffee can be particularly beneficial during a fast, as it can blunt hunger.</p><h4 id="a98e" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">2. Isn’t It Unhealthy to Skip Breakfast?</h4><p>No. The problem is that most stereotypical breakfast skippers have unhealthy lifestyles. If you make sure to eat healthy food for the rest of the day then the practice is perfectly healthy.</p><h4 id="7dc6" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">3. Can I Take Supplements While Fasting?</h4><p>Yes. However, keep in mind that some supplements like fat-soluble vitamins may work better when taken with meals.</p><h4 id="3f0e" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">4. Can I Work out While Fasted?</h4><p>Yes, fasted workouts are fine. Some people recommend taking branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) before a fasted workout.</p><h4 id="6346" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">5. Will Fasting Cause Muscle Loss?</h4><p>All weight loss methods can cause muscle loss, which is why it’s important to lift weights and keep your protein intake high. One study showed that intermittent fasting causes less muscle loss than regular calorie restriction.</p><h4 id="2cff" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">6. Will Fasting Slow Down My Metabolism?</h4><p>No. Studies show that short-term fasts actually boost metabolism. However, longer fasts of 3 or more days can suppress metabolism.</p><h4 id="b7f2" class="lt lu ji bn lv lw lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq hj">7. Should Kids Fast?</h4><p>Allowing your child to fast is probably a bad idea.</p></div><footer><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://getshredgo.net/authors/rish/" class="invert" title="Rish">Rish</a></h3><p class="author__desc">Rish is a certified fitness &amp; nutrition trainer.</p></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://getshredgo.net/everything-you-need-to-know-about-high-cholesterol/" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">Everything You Need to Know About High Cholesterol</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://getshredgo.net/how-to-lose-weight-in-3-simple-steps/" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">How to Lose Weight in 3 Simple Steps</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://instagram.com/GetShredGo" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://getshredgo.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Made on  with love.</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {

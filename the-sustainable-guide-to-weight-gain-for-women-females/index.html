Despite the fact that obesity has been a problem for many people, there are also a lot of people who are suffering from underweight problems. The notion of exercise has always been associated with weight loss, but that is critical in the weight gain process as well. While gaining weight isn't all rainbow and sunshine, it requires a great deal of effort, and eating chocolate treats to boost healthy weight gain isn't exactly the solution to good eating. A healthy diet plan is the only real method to stay healthy and fit that may be achieved with only a good diet plan.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/wMdT1JwG/christopher-campbell-k-FCdf-Lbu6z-A-unsplash.jpg" alt="Fitness guide for to weight gain for women" width="702" height="468"></figure><p>We have created a diet chart for women to help them add weight in only seven days and a diet plan for weight gain. By eating the foods and meals listed, you'll be satisfied and won't experience any discomfort. All the local ingredients and spices will complement your Indian taste buds.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight align-center"><strong>Why weight gain is as important as weight loss</strong></p><p>Obesity has become well-known and more common in the last few years, but being underweight has health risks and disadvantages as well. That makes it critical to be aware of weight gain, the proper, and healthy way. Poor nutrition and being underweight are associated with growth and development problems in younger children and teenagers, but adult subjects need to be on the lookout as well. Overeating skinnyness can lead to health difficulties like anaemia, diminished immune functionality, nutrient deficiencies, osteoporosis, and even raise the risk of future surgical complications.  Besides that, numerous mental issues can seep in as well, including eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa, which is often connected with being underweight. To ensure you don’t consume junk foods or meals that have higher calorie counts, but follow a healthy diet plan for weight gain so that you may have a healthier and happier future.</p><p>If done properly, and with the <a href="https://getshredgo.net/best-online-personal-trainer-for-weight-loss-india/">guidance of a fitness coach</a>, weight gain of the body results in both muscle and fat weight increase. It is preferable to stay away from tasty, greasy food and look at whole grain and meals containing healthy fats instead.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight align-center"><strong>8 tips to gain weight in a healthy way:</strong></p><ul><li>Avoid drinking water before your meal. This habit can fill your stomach even before eating enough hence leading you to eat less nutritious food and be filled in liquid instead.</li><li>Add more eating hours. If you aren’t the type who can take heavy meals at once then keep snack breaks where you can munch on healthy and tasty foods.</li><li>Switch over to milk from carbonated drinks. Drinking whole milk is a great and simple way to incorporate high-quality protein and calories when you wish to quench your thirst. Choosing carbonated sugary drinks will only increase sugar levels in your body instead of doing it any good.</li><li>Though opting for all-natural things is always better trying weight gain shakes which are made from organic products is not a bad idea for that little extra calorie intake of the day.</li><li>Use larger plates. Eating in bigger plates makes sure you are taking meals in bigger proportions and the human psyche of finishing what is on your plate will guarantee you get the nutrients of that one full plate at least.</li><li>Getting good sleep is important as it helps in muscle growth which will further add muscle mass to your body as well.</li><li>Reducing stress should be our top priority as well, as stress can affect hormones and thus lead to change in appetite and metabolization.</li><li>Keep your proteins for first and vegetables for the last. When your plate is a mix of everything it's always better to eat calorie-dense foods like protein first and vegetables at the last of the meal so if you wish to leave anything out the lower calorie foods can be skipped.</li></ul><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/tJtRWTfC/gursimrat-ganda-TT042b-Oytl-U-unsplash.jpg" alt="Fitness guide for to weight gain for women" width="702" height="468"></figure><p class="msg msg--highlight align-center"><strong>List of healthy food items you can incorporate in your diet plan</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Whole grains:</strong> Whole grain foods like bread, and cereals are packed with healthy complex carbohydrates, fibre, and various other nutrients.</li><li><strong>High-calorie foods:</strong> Taking starchy food like potato, corn, legumes, and more that are high in calories is a great way to boost the growth of muscles as well as helps in speeding up weight gain.</li><li><strong>Protein-rich foods/ meat:</strong> If non-vegetarian food works for you then it's advised to add leaner cuts in your diet which are healthier and will provide enough protein. So if you are a fan of seafood as well then going for a fish like salmon would be better than any other heavy fish like canned tuna. Or else for vegetarians, indulging in paneer, soya, chickpeas is a great option to get the required protein.</li><li><strong>Nuts and nut butters:</strong> Calorie-dense nuts are always a great option as they can be added to various dishes and are a healthy snack to munch on as well.</li><li><strong>Milk:</strong> For those who are looking for some muscle gain, milk can be an ideal choice. A balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats, is a complete meal in itself.</li><li><strong>Fruits:</strong> Be it dry fruits or raw natural fruits, incorporating them into your diet plan is always advised as they are rich in calories as well as nutrients.</li></ul><p>To smooth and simple weight gain journey, you should i<strong>ncrease 300-400 calories to your daily calorie intake</strong>, but 700 calories can be consumed for quicker results. You should gradually increase your daily calorie intake rather than consuming all fats at once. You should <strong>also include weight training</strong> to your daily routine along with a diet plan to accelerate your weight gain journey and obtain better, healthier outcomes.</p><p>Our 7-day diet chart for weight gain for females, which consists of 1400-1500 calories, is ideal for the majority and common as well.

This condition is mainly hereditary and is passed from mothers through generations. The main underlying cause for this condition is a hormonal imbalance, especially an increase in the androgens (male hormones). It is a highly common condition and more prevalent in women of the age group 12-45 years.</p><p><strong>The clinical features of PCOD are:</strong></p><ul><li aria-level="1">Irregular ovulation.</li><li aria-level="1">Obesity.</li><li aria-level="1">Alopecia or Male pattern baldness.</li><li aria-level="1">Irregular periods.</li><li aria-level="1">Difficulty in conception.</li></ul><p><strong>PCOS</strong> called Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome is a condition more severe than PCOD. <span class="gvxzyvdx aeinzg81 t7p7dqev gh25dzvf tb6i94ri gupuyl1y i2onq4tn b6ax4al1 gem102v4 ncib64c9 mrvwc6qr sx8pxkcf f597kf1v cpcgwwas m2nijcs8 hxfwr5lz k1z55t6l oog5qr5w tes86rjd pbevjfx6 ztn2w49o" dir="auto">The polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most common cause of infertility due to anovulation which affects 4-7% of women following criteria are sufficient for the diagnosis.oligo and/0r anovulation,clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries at ultrasound. </span>In this, the ovaries produce more male hormones, which leads to a higher number of non-functional follicles/cysts in the ovaries per cycle. The higher number of these cysts leads to anovulatory cycles, where a mature egg is not available for fertilization. This leads to infertility. </p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/BnX6w2wd/linkedin-sales-solutions-VKJt1-EZHl-Ws-unsplash.jpg" alt="How to manage PCOS and PCOD with diet" width="702" height="468"></figure><p><strong>The clinical features of PCOS are:</strong></p><ul><li aria-level="1">Enlarged and bulky ovaries with more than 10ml volume, leading to overproduction of androgens.</li><li aria-level="1">More than 12  follicles, each measuring 2 to 9 millimeters in diameter, organized around the lining of the ovary like a necklace.</li><li aria-level="1">Irregular or missing periods.</li><li aria-level="1">Heavy periods.</li><li aria-level="1">Acne.</li><li aria-level="1">Hair loss (male pattern baldness).</li><li aria-level="1">Android (Apple-shaped) type of obesity. </li><li aria-level="1">Infertility.</li><li aria-level="1">Insulin resistance.</li><li aria-level="1">Gestational diabetes.</li><li aria-level="1">Excess body-weight.</li><li aria-level="1">Hirsutism (excess hair growth on various parts of the body).</li></ul><p class="msg msg--highlight">PCOS, if left untreated, leads to other lifestyle disorders like obesity, type 2 diabetes and increase in blood cholesterol levels.</p><p>The physical changes seen in PCOS can severely affect the confidence or self-esteem of women and their body image that contributes to psychological disturbances like anxiety and depression.

The abnormalities could be, low levels of hormones like progesterone due to infrequent ovulation, overproduction of androgens which could trigger insulin resistance and abnormal androgen levels that signals the over-production of follicles.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">PCOS is a metabolic syndrome, whereas PCOD is a milder condition that can improve with the right nutrition &amp; exercise.</p><p>Women with PCOS are at a higher risk for other comorbidities like insulin resistance, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders &amp; endometrial cancers.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">Symptoms of PCOS like excess facial hair, acne, weight gain are visible at an early age.</p><p>Women with PCOD do not have many issues getting pregnant as seeking medical advice can help drastically, but those with PCOS have a higher risk of infertility &amp; also risk of miscarriage.</p><p>Women with PCOD may ovulate despite having symptoms similar to that of PCOS. But in the latter condition, ovulation is hampered due to the severe hormonal imbalance.</p><p>Ovaries in PCOS are very bulky with high volume &amp; contain approximately 12-15 cysts. Ovaries with PCOD in contrast may not be very bulky and may contain around 5-8 cysts.</p><p>Lastly, PCOS is not as common as PCOD.</p><figure class="post__image"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zfhfq8N7/thought-catalog-UK78i6v-K3sc-unsplash.jpg" alt="How to manage PCOS and PCOD with diet" width="702" height="468"></figure><p class="msg msg--highlight"><strong>How to manage PCOS / PCOD Condition</strong></p><ul><li aria-level="1">Weight loss with an increase in fat-free mass is the mainstay for improvement of both PCOD &amp; PCOS according to the International Evidence-based Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS.</li><li aria-level="1">As insulin resistance is mostly associated with PCOS, women should cut down on simple sugars &amp; rather include more whole foods rich in complex carbohydrates in their diet.</li><li aria-level="1">Weight loss will not just increase the chances of ovulation &amp; subsequent pregnancy, but also minimize the risk of miscarriage.</li><li aria-level="1">Regular physical activity &amp; a balanced diet can help in long-term weight management.</li><li aria-level="1">An appropriate and effective dietary recommendation is still a debate for PCOS. According to a few studies, dietary intake was assessed in women with PCOS, and it was found that these women consumed high glycemic index carbohydrates such as white bread and fried potatoes. Of all the popular diets, the Mediterranean diet promotes low GI carbohydrates, high fiber, unsaturated fats, vegetables and fruits (a rich source of vitamins and antioxidants) and is found to be effective in the management of various lifestyle disorders like insulin resistance, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia etc. Hence, it is also suggested for women with PCOS though this requires more supportive evidence. .</li><li aria-level="1">Lean women with PCOS should aim to maintain the bodyweight with consumption of a balanced diet as mentioned in the dietary recommendations. This can help with improving insulin resistance and overproduction of androgens.</li><li aria-level="1">Increasing the level of physical activity (either aerobic or anaerobic) aimed at reducing BMI, helps reduce the ovarian volume &amp; also the number of follicles.</li><li aria-level="1">A recent study has shown that high intensity aerobic activity of at least 3 days per week for 30 min or more per day with greater than or equal to 60% of VO2 max is advised to improve insulin resistance. Also, a combination workout that includes strength or resistance training thrice a week may help with managing the androgen levels.</li><li aria-level="1">Excess hair growth (hirsutism) due to PCOS/PCOD can be managed by various methods like laser hair removal treatment and the use of oral contraceptives to suppress androgen production.</li><li aria-level="1">Acne that is mild to moderate can be treated with topical applications like benzoyl peroxide or clindamycin creams.</li><li aria-level="1">For mental health in women with PCOS, physical exercise, in turn, group exercise has shown a  better outcome of quality of life.</li></ul></div><footer><div class="post__tags-share"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://getshredgo.net/tags/disease-prevention/">Disease Prevention</a></li></ul><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgetshredgo.net%2Fpcod-vs-pcos-and-how-to-manage-both%2F" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://getshredgo.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetshredgo.net%2Fpcod-vs-pcos-and-how-to-manage-both%2F&amp;via=%40getshredgo&amp;text=PCOD%20vs%20PCOS%20and%20how%20to%20manage%20both" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://getshredgo.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetshredgo.net%2Fpcod-vs-pcos-and-how-to-manage-both%2F" class="js-share linkedin" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://getshredgo.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=PCOD%20vs%20PCOS%20and%20how%20to%20manage%20both https%3A%2F%2Fgetshredgo.net%2Fpcod-vs-pcos-and-how-to-manage-both%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://getshredgo.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></aside></div><div class="post__bio author"><div><h3 class="h6 author__name"><a href="https://getshredgo.net/authors/rish/" class="invert" title="Rish">Rish</a></h3><p class="author__desc">Rish is a certified fitness &amp; nutrition trainer.</p></div></div><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav__prev"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://getshredgo.net/the-sustainable-guide-to-weight-gain-for-women-females/" rel="prev">Previous Post<h3 class="h6">The Sustainable Guide To Weight Gain For Women</h3></a></div><div class="post__nav__next"><a class="post__nav__link" href="https://getshredgo.net/post-pregnancy-weight-loss-tips-diet-plan-and-foods-to-eat/" rel="prev">Next Post<h3 class="h6">Post Pregnancy Weight Loss: Tips, Diet Plan &amp; Foods to Eat</h3></a></div></nav></footer></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://twitter.com/GetShredGo" aria-label="Twitter" class="twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="https://getshredgo.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://instagram.com/GetShredGo" aria-label="Instagram" class="instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://getshredgo.net/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Made on  with love.</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
